## Get an HF Token for LLM Downloads

This guide explains how to get and use a Hugging Face token, focusing on downloading Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Why You Need a Token

* To authenticate downloads from the Hugging Face Hub.
* **Required** for **gated models** (like Llama, Gemma, etc.) *after* you accept their specific terms online on the model's page.
* Ensures smoother downloads of **public models**, especially when using libraries like `transformers`.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Hugging Face Account:** You need an account at [https://huggingface.co/](https://huggingface.co/).
2.  **For Gated Models:** Before attempting to download, you **must** visit the specific model's page on the Hub **first** (while logged in) and accept its terms/license online. The download will fail otherwise, even with a valid token.

### How to Get Your Token

1.  **Log in** to your account at [https://huggingface.co/](https://huggingface.co/).
2.  Go to **Settings** (click your profile picture in the top-right corner).
3.  Click **Access Tokens** in the left-hand menu.
4.  Generate a **`New token`**:
    * Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `llm-download-token`).
    * Select the **`read`** role (this is sufficient for downloading models).
    * Click **"Generate a token"**.
    * **Copy** the generated token string (it will start with `hf_...`). Save it securely.
    * *(Alternatively, you can copy an existing token with `read` permissions if you already have one suitable)*.

### How to Use the Token for Downloads

Make the token available to your download tools (like `huggingface_hub`, `transformers`, etc.) or scripts:

* **Recommended:** Use the Hugging Face Command Line Interface (CLI). If you haven't already, install it (`pip install -U huggingface_hub`). Then, log in via your terminal:
    ```bash
    huggingface-cli login
    ```
    Paste your copied token (`hf_...`) when prompted. This command securely stores the token locally, and libraries will typically use it automatically when needed.

* **Alternative:** Set the `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` environment variable before running your script.
    * *Linux/macOS:*
        ```bash
        export HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN='hf_YourTokenHere'
        ```
    * *Windows (Command Prompt):*
        ```cmd
        set HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_YourTokenHere
        ```
    * *Windows (PowerShell):*
        ```powershell
        $env:HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN='hf_YourTokenHere'
        ```

*(Libraries like `transformers` usually detect and use the token automatically from either the CLI login cache or the environment variable when they need to download authenticated models.)*

### Security

* Treat your Hugging Face token like a password.
* Keep it **private** and secure.
* Do not embed it directly in code shared publicly or commit it to version control systems (like Git).
* Use tokens with the appropriate role (`read` is usually sufficient for downloads).
