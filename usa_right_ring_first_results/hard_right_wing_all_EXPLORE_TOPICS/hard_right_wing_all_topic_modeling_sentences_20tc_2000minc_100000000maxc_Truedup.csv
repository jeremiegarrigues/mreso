"and you watch things and pay attention to things and are captivated by things that are not predicated on those assumptions and , it seems , to me , that there is a problem of what the world is made out of , but there is a bigger problem and that is the problem of how you should conduct yourself in the world and that is what you really want to know , people want to know that more than anything because you need to know , it 's like , here you guys are in university , you do not know what you are doing i mean , some of you know more than others but you are at the beginning of your life and life is very complex and chaotic and it is not exactly obvious , you know , what kind of relationship you should form , or what sort of character you should develop or what you are going to do for a job , or what 's the meaning of life , that 's a good one , what 's the meaning of life well , and you know , people come to university , at least many of them , and that 's kind of what they want to find out now paglia , her notion is that you could think about it this way , is that articulated knowledge is embedded in inarticulate knowledge and inarticulate knowledge is , a domain of literature and art high culture let us say and it 's , we sort of know what it means but we do not know exactly know what it means , it means more than we know and then outside of that is what we do not know at all and that 's an idea that jung developed as well and maybe paglia picked it up from jung because jung believed that you know , there was this domain that we had mastered in every domain , and then there was domain outside of that you could think of as unexplored territory and what we met unexplored territory with was our creative imagination and what we were trying to do with our creative imagination is to figure out how to deal with that unexplored territory , we are producing dramas that we could act out that would help us deal with what we still have not mastered and outside of that there is just what we do not know at all and paglia 's idea , and this was jung 's idea was that without understanding that surround you are too atomized you are not part of your historical tradition you have not incorporated the spirit of your ancestors who built all this you are just here now and , and you do not know what to do either , you do not know how to maintain your culture and you do not know how to serve it and , you know you might say why should you serve your culture and , well i have a hypothesis about that , you know you can think about this , i do not know if it 's true but people ask what the meaning of life is , and it seems to me that meaning is proportionate to the adoption of responsibility you know , like let us say have a little sister who 's like three you are going to take care of her questioning whether that is a good idea seems stupid you know what i mean , it just does not seem like the right kind of question it 's like , well obviously self evidently , let us say , that 's what you do and , do you find it meaningful , it 's like probably you know , interacting with a little kid when i had little kids , you know when they were like two and under we took them out to seetheir relatives and they were older people you know , they watched that two year old like it was a fire you know , every second that that little kid was in the room every single adult was focused on , focused on , on him or her",0.1928,trump was not wiretapped trump 's claim is baseless and then paul manafort was wiretapped we do not know that trump tower was was wiretapped we do not know that so trump might still be wrong he might still be right both sides have repeatedly been trying to claim that they are correct that trump is right or wrong people who support trump trump is clearly correct people who do not like trump trump 's making this up but the reality is there 's no real conclusive evidence to suggest he was or was not in fact i would say the only reasonable position is that if paul manafort was wiretapped and was living in trump tower it is likely to some extent a phone at least in trump tower was wiretapped and considering the size of the sir state it is likely that trump somehow got caught up in that long story short the benefit of the doubt goes to donald trump everyone is so desperate to be correct that they are just arguing semantics at this point during the election there was the saying that was going around that trump supporters take him seriously but not literally and the people who do not like trump take him literally but not seriously i do not think that 's necessarily the case i think it 's whether or not you will give trump the benefit of the doubt again twitter is not a great place to give out specific information and details about what exactly is going on the people who follow trump will see his tweet and say wow trump was being surveilled in some capacity and the people who do not like trump are going to say prove that your phone was temped specifically and then both sides are going to run with that and say this is proof so paul manafort working on the trump campaign communicate with trump i would personally say the benefit of the doubt goes to trump but let us take another look at trump 's tweets how low has president obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process this is nixon / watergate bad or sick guy people on the right wore supporting trump are acting as though the paul manafort revelation or story is somehow proof that trump was correct but he said obama tapped my phone so that 's still a stretch even if one phone in trump tower was tapped yes you could argue that 's trump 's phone but that 's a stretch to justify your position the reality is we still do not know other than the doj said that donald trump was not being surveilled or wiretapped so the issue is right now was trump being literal 100 % literal when he said that obama tapped had his head his wires tapped i do not know do you trust it out trump or not well guess what people who do not trust him are going to say he was and people who do tell some we are going to say he was not the reality is this paul manta ford story does nothing it 's not the first time we have heard that people within the donald trump circle were being surveilled or investigated so why is all of a sudden everyone acting like this is some grand revelation and sure enough i guess because of all the memes among the write right now cnn has a story once again saying that donald trump has no proof that it was wiretapped going into great detail about how even if paul man forte 's wiretapping caught donald trump in say a conversation that trump 's conversation would be removed,0.5475,but it 's often the left accusing the dog whistle of being for the right when it 's the left who is noticing or insinuating that there is some kind of ulterior motive or hidden connotation to these statements the night foundation last month published this paper called free expression on campus what college students think about first amendment issues in it they say students value both free expression and inclusion though their commitment to free expression may be stronger in the abstract than in reality majorities of students say protecting free speech rights 56 % and promoting a diverse inclusive society 52 % are extremely important to democracy students continue to prefer campuses be open learning environments that allow for a wide range of views to be heard then to prefer environments that prohibit certain types of potentially harmful speech though not as widely as they did in 2016 my personal opinion i do think there is a free speech crisis i do think there 's ideological biases at these universities in tech industries and things like that but that does not mean that most people disagree with free speech and most people want to shut down speakers when we look at the numbers for the night foundation and we can see that there 's a majority of students 56 % who believe that free speech is important and then 52 % believe diversity is also important what that means is there is still a substantial group of people who disagree with that now of those people who disagree do you think they are all out wearing black masks and shutting down speaking events no of course not most of them are probably minding their own business and just saying i personally disagree however this is still a large group of individuals and within that you are going to have an even smaller fringe group of radicals who want to shut down speakers and i think this is where the free speech crisis comes from going back to our first story about this professor this is just one incident but it is part of the problem at universities we do not need to have every single professor every single student saying you are not allowed to speak your ideas are wrong to have a crisis if 15 people show up with molotov cocktails baseball bats and black masks and they keep doing it and they keep shutting down certain ideas that is a fringe minority creating a serious problem at universities and if universities and very their industries are not going to deal with these fringe radical groups we do have a problem the problem is twofold a group of people who would shut down free speech and the authority who is supposed to actually say this is what you can and can not do like the police for instance or the administration of these colleges not doing anything about this or not doing enough i feel like when it comes to these small fringe groups of violent extremists no matter what side they are on people are too afraid to actually stand up to them and say that 's not ok when i was at berkeley during the milo free speech week event that was not really a week - long event i spoke with some very progressive students and they told me they do not mind if there were controversial ideas at their campus because they are spending a lot of money to learn and to expand their views they personally disagreed with a lot of conservative speakers but actually expressed that they were angry that protesters kept disrupting events and shutting down the school shutting down classrooms these were students who were very progressive you could even call them social justice activists and they do not like the radical fringe group disrupting the university so even though we see that there is almost a majority of people who disagree with the idea for expressional universities these people are not necessarily shutting these events down one of the biggest mistakes people make when talking about a crisis is they assume simply because most people agree with free speech there 's no crisis but all it takes is 10 people seriously it could take one person supergluing the locks shut at various stores and if they keep doing it you do have a problem that person needs to be stopped because you can not do that in this instance when it comes to free speech we actually have dozens of individuals many of which who do not even attend berkeley using berkeley as an example when these events were going on you had people from upstate you had people from oregon from washington coming down to california to protest conservative speakers this is a problem we can do these surveys we can find that college students overwhelmingly do agree with free speech at the same time diversity but it 's not necessarily the majority that 's causing the problems so these news outlets can say it over and over again that there is no crisis but the idea of a crisis is just an opinion because at what point does a situation a circumstance become a crisis at what point is a series of events become a controversy or crisis it 's really in the eye of the beholder and some people think there is and some people think there is not personally i think if you have got groups of individuals wearing black masks throwing firebombs firecrackers bringing poles bats and weapons and actually physically assaulting people you do have a crisis and when you look at other events like even charlottesville when you have these clashes in the streets the crisis is not one - sided albeit when talking about free speech and for expression at universities it tends to be just the left shutting down conservative events but when it comes to these street battles no one 's innocent everybody 's showing up knowing there 's going to be a fight they are engaging in these fights and it is in my opinion a crisis many people have talked about an upcoming potential civil war because of this many people on the left are saying that they have to win there was an article recently that jack dorsey the ceo of twitter tweeted out saying that we have to win we in reference to the left must win one side must prevail and this kind of rhetoric scares me the first story is just a viral incident that 's kind of offending everybody because the student was arguing that anybody can be sexually assaulted because of your gender and that 's not a conservative opinion that is widely accepted as true that anybody can be sexually assaulted and to have this professor on a rant and argue the student and seemingly target him because of a concern of ideas then i mean that 's that 's pretty egregious and so that 's going to get highlighted but it does lend itself to the larger picture of ideological bias and a crisis in american colleges so let me know what you think how do you feel about the first story how do you feel about harvard and this person saying they can not include free speech in their events title because it 's a dog whistle to the far right we will keep the conversation going in the comments below you can follow me on twitter at tim cast stay tuned new videos every day at 4 p.m. thank you all so much for watching and i will see you all tomorrow,0.3067,well it 's being said that rioting broke out in louisville over the grand jury 's decision the brianna taylor case but that 's wrong on two levels for one the chaos in louisville as in so many other cities across the country is funded and organized moments after the grand jury returned only three counts of wanton endangerment against one officer for firing shots that went into a neighbor 's apartment but no charges for taylor 's death u - hauls packed with pre - made signs and riot shields were already on the scene being unloaded now it 's clear that there 's there 's orchestration and planning involved also these are not mere riots these are violent uprisings with the clear and often stated goal of destabilizing the government and burning down the system in other words it 's insurrection so rather than riots breaking out this was another campaign of insurrection being carried out and the distinction is important it 's also important though not relevant to the insurrectionists that the narrative surrounding the brianna taylor case advanced by blm and antifa and their allies in the media has proven to be almost entirely false the narrative in these high - profile police shootings is always false of course the only question is one of degree just how wrong will it turn out to be in nearly all of the high profile cases over the past few months especially that answer has generally varied between extremely and incredibly for example the narrative around the jacob blake uh shooting in kenosha claimed that he was unarmed and shot by cops while trying to get into his car after stopping to break up a fight in reality he was harassing his alleged rape victim was armed with a knife was reaching into his ex - girlfriend 's car which he was allegedly trying to steal when the officer fired in the shooting of dion k in dc we were at first told that kaye was an unarmed child shot in the back as it turns out he was an adult a known gang member and was shot in the chest while running towards officers with his gun drawn the case of ricardo munoz in lancaster activists told us that he was a mentally disabled person randomly gunned down outside his mother 's house some even said there were some blm people online saying he was an autistic child murdered by the cops in reality munoz was 27 years old was shot because he chased after a police officer while wielding a large knife blm has gotten almost every fact of every case wrong going all the way back to michael brown in 2014 he was claimed to have been murdered with his hands up while begging for his life forensic evidence eyewitness reports eventually confirmed that he was actually shot while assaulting a police officer and trying to steal his weapon and this after he had assaulted a store clerk and committed a robbery so what about brianna taylor now initially it was reported that police burst into the wrong apartment without knocking during a botched drug raid and murdered taylor while she was asleep that would be indefensible if it was true but once again it was not as kentucky attorney general daniel cameron explained in his press conference on wednesday officers were serving a legal warrant at the right location and they did knock before entering an independent witness corroborates that they announced and identified themselves upon entering the residents brianna 's taylor brianna teller 's boyfriend kenneth walker opened fired on officers when police returned fire briana taylor was hit and killed here 's a cameron at the press conference explaining some of this evidence shows that officers both knocked and announced their presence at the apartment the officers statements about their announcement are corroborated by an independent witness who was near in a proximity to apartment four in other words the warrant was not served as a no knock warrant when officers were unable to get anyone to answer or open the door to apartment 4 the decision was made to breach the door after breaching the door sergeant mattingly was the first and only officer to enter the residence sergeant mattingly identified two individuals standing beside one another at the end of the hall a male and a female in his statement he says that the male was holding a gun arms extended in a shooting stance sergeant mattingly saw the man 's gun fire heard a boom and immediately knew he was shot as a result of feeling heat in his upper thigh kenneth walker fired the shot that hit sergeant mattingly and there is no evidence to support that sergeant mattingly was hit by friendly fire from other officers now we should mention a warrant was issued for taylor 's apartment because there was reason to suspect that taylor or at least her apartment was in some way involved in her criminal ex - boyfriend 's drug drug enterprise as court documents show taylor 's car was spotted multiple times outside of a known drug house that was under surveillance by law enforcement taylor is on tape reportedly referring to the drug house while speaking to her then boyfriend while he was in jail in 2016 the body of a murder victim was allegedly found in a car rented by taylor which she said she had lent to her boyfriend shortly after her death the ex - boyfriend was again recorded in jailhouse phone conversations claiming that taylor was quote handling his money the point is that the warrant was issued for entirely valid reasons the cops executed it according to the law following all the proper protocols only opened fire after walker had begun shooting at them there is no basis for calling this a murder much less a racist murder by agents of white supremacy it 's a tragic accident a catastrophic confluence of events many other terms can be used to describe it but the fact remains that officers were serving a lawful warrant acting within the bounds of the law and responding with lethal force to the lethal force being used against them as usual those accusing the officers of criminal conduct have not bothered to explain what they might have done differently should they have not obtained the warrant for the apartment in the first place despite having credible reason to believe that it had ties to drug trafficking should they not have executed the warrant should they not have or should they have waited outside for someone to come to the door and if the residents refused to answer then just pack up and go home or should they have not returned fire once once they were fired upon instead you know diving to the floor or hiding behind furniture hoping the assailant stops before a bullet hits one of them in the face now blm militants if they were being honest would actually answer yes to all of those questions they have made it clear that their problem with the police is that the police exist anything the police do therefore is wrong for the simple fact the police are the ones doing it for blm and its allies the fight against police brutality is a fight against policing itself all law enforcement is brutality in their minds and anybody who dies at the hands of police any black person anyway has been murdered no matter what regardless of context this is the radicalism that holds our cities hostage the madness to which we are all supposed to bow it dresses itself in the garb of racial justice it carries signs that say things like equality but this is all a decidedly unconvincing disguise for their radical assault on law and order and civilization itself and that 's what 's happening and now it 's happening in louisville let us get to our five headlines,0.7627,but that was about to rebound to record growth rates he was handed a stable foreign policy and he had been blessed with the unending bounty of sycophantic media coverage welcoming him into the oval office with an approval rating of nearly 56 percent what did he do with these advantages he presided over perhaps the worst first 14 months of any presidency since the civil war and unlike abraham lincoln our current crisis is entirely of joe biden 's making on issue after issue joe biden is not merely wrong he is aggressively wrong he is not merely foolish he is stubbornly foolish joe biden became president with one goal to enshrine himself in history as a great leader today we can safely say that he is one of the worst leaders in american history on foreign policy joe biden has made america a laughing stock our enemies do not respect us they do not fear us they laugh at us biden promised stability he promised he would be the adult in the room instead he has acted like a toddler whining mewling throwing tantrums and then in the end capitulating he precipitously withdrew from afghanistan for no apparent reason and with no actual strategy destroying a country for which america had expended thousands of lives and trillions of dollars by handing it over to a group of eighth century radical islamist barbarians those barbarians promptly blew up 13 american service members and in retaliation joe biden 's reaper drones eviscerated an innocent family including seven children now millions will starve thousands will be sold into sex slavery and terror groups will reconstitute on the very soil from which the attacks of september 11th were launched and thousands of americans were left behind to suffer under the taliban joe biden cut off the keystone xl pipeline and greenlit the russian nordstrom 2 pipeline enriching vladimir putin and destroying america 's energy independence then he proceeded to fuss about uselessly as putin prepared and launched a full - scale invasion of ukraine all of which paves the way for a chinese attack on taiwan and more aggressive chinese moves in the south china sea and when it comes to our own borders joe biden has ushered in the greatest wave of illegal immigration in modern history in his first year joe biden 's administration was on track for two million border apprehensions the reason is clear illegal immigrants have been openly telling media members they are here because they believe joe biden will welcome them meanwhile on our northern warden border joe biden has stood in solidarity with justin trudeau as he claimed emergency powers to crush freedom in canada but at least joe biden has brought transgenderism and diversity equity and inclusion to the defense department do not you feel safer already on the economy joe biden has somehow turned a historic recovery into a chaotic nightmare for four decades inflation had not been a persistent problem in american life today inflation rates are running at a four decade high thanks to his socialistic spending plans and ridiculous regulations wage gains have been erased gas prices are emptying wallets and the hundreds of thousands of small businesses that went dark thanks to democratic induced lockdown policies we will never come back erasing the life savings dreams and jobs of millions of americans we face future stagnation thanks to our unsustainable 30 trillion dollar national debt joe biden blames supply chain problems of course but at least joe biden 's transportation secretary pete butterjudge has been on the case i mean when he 's not taking two months off for paternity leave well nobody in the media seems to care on crime joe biden has consistently cited against police and with those who would make their job harder he has unleashed his department of justice on police departments all over the country and innocent americans many of them black have paid for his soft on crime policies with their lives a dozen major cities have recorded the highest number of homicides ever in the united states but at least his vice president did help bail black lives matter rioters out of prison and then there 's our society joe biden has made nearly every aspect of our society wars joe biden promised america unity when he entered office instead he labeled his fellow americans enemies he encouraged businesses to bar the unvaccinated even those with natural immunity from public spaces then he sought to have them fired from their jobs on mass in the single largest executive overreach in modern american history joe biden treated political dissenters as scum of the earth biden said those who do not agree with his plans to federalize voting procedures were aligned with jim crow and the confederacy biden 's justice department cracked down on parents after being encouraged to do so by the national school boards association which encouraged the doj to treat parents as domestic terrorists for opposing the indoctrination of their children into radical gender and race theory for simply wanting to determine how their kids were educated joe biden 's administration slurred traditionally moral americans as retrograde bigots for the great sin of believing that men are men and women are women joe biden 's white house encouraged social media to shut down critics for misinformation and define this information as anything the white house do not like and then he and his lackeys said he was doing this in defense of the science as it turns out joe biden is not merely a brutal failure of a president he 's an aspiring tyrant held back only by the strength of our constitutional structure a structure he now wishes to overthrow by trashing the filibuster issuing unconstitutional executive orders and at least threatening to pack the supreme court and of course joe biden is a liar he does not lie as well as he used to he 's no longer capable of speaking smoothly or coherently but if a man spends a lifetime lying he 's not going to start telling the truth when he enters his eighth decade tonight joe biden lied and lied and lied again to you for example joe biden told you tonight that his plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit he said he would lower inflation by pouring more cash into the economy on top of the trillions he has already spent well we are 30 trillion dollars in debt that is an insane lie build back better would according to the congressional budget office increase the federal budget deficit by 3 trillion dollars over the next 10 years if all bidens proposed temporary programs became permanent which is what he wants and pouring the gasoline of government spending onto the raging fire of inflation is a perfect way to increase costs only a fool would propose it maybe that 's why joe biden was telling you until the last five minutes that inflation would be temporary andrew biden told you that his american rescue plan his massive boondoggle stimulus plan created jobs lots of jobs he said he created 6.5 million jobs that is another lie there is no evidence biden 's spending produced one job nonpartisan projections for job growth in 2021 not including that american rescue plan showed higher job growth than biden produced joe biden said we prepared extensively for the russian invasion of ukraine that was untrue we were manifestly unprepared we reacted as the rest of the world did and should have but had joe biden been prepared perhaps he could have helped deter russia 's invasion rather than encouraging vladimir putin 's miscalculation joe biden also told you tonight that corporations and the wealthiest americans are not paying their fair share of taxes that again is a lie the highest income americans pay nearly all net income taxes after government benefits in the united states joe biden said that inflation could be blamed on exploitation by corporations another lie inflation is a monetary phenomenon corporations do not get more greedy last year joe biden just became president and joe biden said we will never just accept living with coven 19 another lie most americans have been living free since vaccines became available only democratic panic mongering has prevented more americans from doing the same not covet itself joe biden said tonight that the right to vote is under assault another lie widespread voter suppression is not an issue in the united states joe biden simply means he wants to rig the voting rules the way he prefers lie after lie after lie enough enough of joe biden enough of his bizarrely incompetent vice president who has failed upward into every job she has ever held and who can not seem to keep a straight face when asked a straight question enough of his senate majority leader who spends more time worrying about being primaried by an instagram communist than worrying about passing solid bipartisan legislation enough of his speaker of the house who kneels in kensei cloth in the capital rotunda to protest america 's supposed racism then goes home and eats gelato in front of her sub - zero fridge as businesses are forced into bankruptcy by her preferred policies america deserves better america deserves a president who sides with parents rather than corrupt teachers unions that shut down schools and mask toddlers and indoctrinate kids into the perverse lies of gender theory and the overt bigotry of critical race theory america deserves a president who sides with the police who protect law - abiding citizens rather than the criminals who target them or the black lives matter radicals who slander america as systemically racist while pocketing tens of millions in cash america deserves a president who sides with innovators rather than the jealous plutocrats who seek to steal wealth they never created and use it to pay off their friends america deserves a president who sides with freedom of speech rather than demanding that social media companies crack down on everything he does not like america deserves a president who sides with the blue - collar workers who pay his salary not the blue checkmarks on twitter america deserves a president who sides with those who take their families to church every sunday not those who pledge to blot out our shared judeo - christian heritage from public life america deserves a president who sides with america 's allies rather than surrendering to america 's enemies america deserves a president who sides with the constitution rather than seeking to rewrite it to push forward his bureaucratic tyranny we are more than a year into joe biden 's presidency that year is an unblemished record of failure viciousness and lies too many americans have been told by the radical left and its compliant lackeys in the media that america is rooted in racism and bigotry that freedom is dangerous that if we listen to the experts and delegate control over our lives to them all will be well too many americans listened and so we are in the midst of a great american decline but that decline is reversible it starts now attend your local school board meetings demand an end to the radical indoctrination of your children join campaigns in your cities and states for candidates who care about your rights vote joe biden 's enablers out of congress and the senate in november and then vote joe biden out of office in 2024 the great american renewal begins when their control of american lives ends you,1.3552,"the things that we have been seeing on our screens from kamas are atrocities obviously but the media have said that these atrocities they are really missing context the context they are providing well that context is a bunch of [ music ] lies there are four myths generally propagated by the left around the history of israel and the palestinians these myths matter because they lead people into a peculiar moral relativism whereby attempted murder or success murder of jews is excused and meanwhile the evil human rights violations of the palestinians are minimized myth number one israel is historically muslim territory this is a pure and absolute lie israel is historically jewish territory according to the bible and certain interpretations of contemporaneous archeology joshua entered the land of israel in 14400 bc the kingdom of david was found around 1,000 bc the first temple of solomon was built in approximately 957 bc the second temple was built in approximately 550 15 bc the hesm monian dynasty was founded in 166 bc jerusalem was destroyed in 70 bc and the jews exiled from israel in 136 ce after the defeat of the baraka revolt the romans in an attempt to shame the jews renamed the area palestine as an insult after the jews historic enemy the philistines even during the exile there was continuous jewish presence in the land islam which is the religion of the palestinian arabs was not even founded until the 7th century ce or ad no independent arab state has ever existed in the area known as palestine myth number two israel is the cause of the failure of land partition in the middle east this is again a pure lie in 1917 the british promised the jews the entire area of palestine at the time israel and trans jordan which is today 's jordan in 1920 the arabs began prrams a mass murder of jews in jerusalem as a sign of anger at the british mandate in palestine in 1922 the british government in response announced in a white paper paper that the trans jordan area 70 % of palestine would be sliced off and made an arab state that would become jordan in 1937 the appeal commission recommended a rump state for the jews in which the british would retain control over japa and jerusalem the arabs would get the entire neev and nearly the entirety of judea and samaria and the jews would get a tiny swath of territory along the coast including tel aviv and kifa in 1939 the british in response again to arab pressure restricted jewish immigration to palestine just as the nazis began world war ii and just before the holocaust nonetheless the jews sided with the brits the arabs sided with hitler in 1948 the british mandate ended and israel declared its independence david benan read the proclamation of independence to 13 other members of the israel provisional national council israel had taken its place among the nations of the world in 1964 with the arabs still in full control of the gaza strip and west bank the palestine liberation organization was founded calling for the destruction of israel here is a contemporaneous british report i am the first chairman of the palestine liberation organization one of the most extreme anti - israeli politicians in the arab world ahmed el shuker the leader of the palestine liberation organization as the spokesman for 1 million palestine refugees he 's found the flames of hatred for israel with unflagging energy in 1967 the arab league announced the three nos no peace no recognition no negotiations with all of israel 's enemies mobil in against it israel launched a preemptive strike on the egyptian air force inaugurating the 1967 6 day war this ended with israel gaining miraculously the sinai desert the golan heights the gaza strip judea and samaria now known as the west bank as well as the entirety of jerusalem in 1973 the arabs launched all that war again this time on yung kapur israel survived and gained territory in 1979 is israel gave the siai back to egypt in return for peace in 1993 israel agreed to the oslo accords which promised a step - by - step process to establish a palestinian state in 1998 israel conceded yet more territory to the palestinian authority under the prime ministership of benjamin netanyahu in 2000 israeli prime minister aud barack offered yaser arafat the terrorist leader of the palestinian authority 91 % control over the west bank in contiguous territory and an israeli security presence along 15 % of the border with jordan ara walked away from the table and began the second inata a massive terror wave that ended with the death of thousands of jews in 2005 israel unilaterally withdrew from the gaza strip hamas immediately took it over and began using it as a base for terrorist activity that continues until this day in 2008 israeli prime minister aud omer offered even more than barack in terms of territory with some land swaps to maintain jewish populated areas in exchange for some israeli territory om even offered to relinquish israeli sovereignty at the temple mount the holy of sight and judaism as well as the entire old city of jerusalem to a five member non - sovereign international trustee ship comprising israel the pa jordan the us and saudi arabia pa head munas walked away without a counter offer myth number three israel expelled all palestinian arabs from british mandate palestine this is again a lie israel 's founding documents asked arabs to stay israel 's declaration of independence in the middle of an ongoing war with arab nations reads quote we appeal in the very midst of the onslaught launched against us now for months to the arab inhabitants of the state of israel to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the state on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions debate has raged for decades over how many arabs left the nent state of israel thanks to expulsion and how many left because they were told to leave by their own leaders an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 refugees left before their homes were even in a war zone we do not compel them to leave they left on their own will or rather on the will of arab leaders who the adv them even before trouble started the collapse of arab society during the 1947 - 48 war leaving many arabs without a means of support has been well documented israel will do everything in its power to help the resettlement of these refugees by paying compensation and by other means hundreds of thousands of these refugees ended up in the west bank and gaza which remained arab territory until 1967 furthermore arab nations refused to take in hundreds of thousands of arabs turning their co - religionists into refugees who have maintained that status for literally decades a situation unparalleled in human history fully 62 % of such refugees live outside the west bank and gaza strip according to the unrwa meanwhile israel tiny israel took in over 800,000 jews expelled from arab land between 1948 and 1951 and never asked for land to be returned to those jews myth number four israel is an apartheid state israel is most certainly not an apartheid state arab citizens of israel have the same rights as jewish citizens 20 % of all citizens of israel are arab the vast majority of palestinians live under palestinian rule in the west bank all arabs in the gaza strip lived under kamas rule israel 's population again is 20 % arab arab parties have sat in the israeli government and arab sits on israel supreme court there are zero jews living under palestinian rule the only apartheid state is any state of palestine all of these myths have consequences all of these lies have consequences they lead to a pseudo sophisticated context that allows for the murder of jews it allows people in the west to believe that the grievances that are openly articulated by the palestinian authority islamic jihad and hamas are actually about territory hamas openly calls for the murder of every jew in the region the palestinian authority gives actual bounties to the families of terrorists islamic jihad has the same exact goals as hamas when evil people say they want to wipe jews off the face of the earth we ought to listen not make up silly excuses as to why they do not actually mean what they say the consequences of buying your own lies not even their lies your own lies is dead jews the world has witnessed the heinous attack by hamas terrorists against innocent israeli citizens this massive and devastating attack killed over a thousand israeli men women children babies thousands more were injured kidnapped held hostage this sworn enemy of israel will stop at nothing to slaughter every single jew and claim israel as their own but there is a beacon of hope amidst the chaos the international fellowship of christians and jews is on the ground right now providing critical essentials like food medicine and other emergency supplies for vulnerable jews who need immediate help but the need is massive and urgent this great organization needs your help right now to donate please go to ben forthe fellowship.org give as generously as you can write it down it 's ben forthe fellowship.org thank you",2.0326,"120 reported incidents took place in gender neutral changing rooms and just 14 were in single sex changing areas unisex facilities account for less than half of the changing areas across the uk but the number is on the rise doing away with separate male and female changing rooms and toilets is seen as a way to cut staff costs and better care for transgender people these figures show that women and girls are more vulnerable in mixed changing rooms and there is a danger these places are becoming a magnet for sexual offenders says david davies mp for monmouth it simply does not make sense to enable men to have greater access to women 's space the reforms to gender recognition will grant that access the concept of unisex changing areas and toilets has proven controversial two years ago visitors to chelsea 's sports center in west london voiced their anger at plans to merge the male and female changing rooms over fears of compromised privacy and increased risk of sexual harassment however it 's not just in swimming pools and leisure centers that unisex changing areas are on the rise high street chain topshop for example has had gender - neutral changing rooms for nearly a year but according to nicola williams spokesman for fair play for women spaces where women are undressed should be single sex as a matter of course this is obvious elementary safeguarding the independent made reference to this story anger over plans to create unisex changing rooms at chelsea swimming pool and this story is from october of 2016 in it they say that people have submitted objections arguing the scheme would compromise their privacy and could lead to sexual harassment caroline daggett said the council will be putting women of all ages including the vulnerable and those with learning difficulties whom likely have no voice here at risk jasmine king leader from hyde park gate said users were concerned that they will always be looking over their shoulder feel uncomfortable and ill at ease trying to change out of and into clothing in a room full of men and women martin arnold surveyors on behalf of the center said it has been noted that while there are several opponents the majority of the user groups will benefit from this scheme the plans have been recommended for approval and a final decision will be made by councilors next tuesday a kensington and chelsea council spokesman said the new layout is widely used it is a proven safe design that actually includes more changing cubicles than are currently available we believe there is no more risk of sexual harassment in these changing rooms than in the version currently in chelsea sports center we have asked pool users for their views and many support the proposals two years ago they said that they do not think there was a greater risk for sexual harassment but now it seems there 's data to suggest otherwise it 's hard to know exactly what 's going to happen before you create the gender - neutral bathrooms and if we look at existing data when most bathrooms were segregated female and male then we are not going to see a lot of instances of men attacking women or vice versa because they are separated so people were arguing that they do not think men would assault or harass women in these spaces because a lot of data to show for it but obviously after we created gender - neutral bathrooms we start to see new data emerge and now it would seem that 's exactly the case that men actually do harass women in these spaces there 's a story from december 2016 in the guardian it says fears around gender - neutral toilets are all in the mind allowing trans people to use gender - neutral facilities does not put women at risk it 's just a distraction from the very real violence we face every day in the article they say the horrible truth is that if a man wants to assault a woman he can do so anywhere the idea that making toilets gender - neutral puts women at risk is a classic slippery slope argument where 's the evidence if flint has proof that gender - neutral toilets put women at risk i am all ears if not i am rather bored by people such as her playing devil 's advocate and whipping up unnecessary panic trans women like me have been using female toilets for decades without causing anyone any problems whatsoever if you are living in britain in 2016 you have almost certainly used a public toilet at the same time as a trans person and not even realized it does not have to be a big deal unless you make it one and this is actually a really interesting point because to an extent it 's true most people have probably used the bathroom of the trans person and not even realized it it 's only actually with the start of this debate that it 's become so high - profile but the mistake being made in this article is that the concern should not be about trans women assaulting women the concern should be that you are putting biological straight men in the same place as biological women so while it may be true that trans women are not going to assault women you are talking about gender - neutral bathrooms you are talking about men being in a private space with women and no one around to see what 's happening and thus i think it 's obvious that we are going to see more assaults take place than if bathrooms were segregated the article goes on the biggest irony while making bathrooms more trans friendly has not led to any problems the fabricated debates surrounding this progress has take 22 year old amy tom 's who was washing her hands in the women 's bathroom at a branch of walmart in connecticut when someone approached her and said you are disgusting and you do not belong here tom 's who was born with a uterus and identifies as woman believes she was harassed because of the current panic about trans people in bathrooms a fuss about a problem that does not exist has become a problem in and of itself with more and more women do not look traditionally feminine now facing greater scrutiny in public earlier this year a 16 year old lesbian was thrown out of a mcdonald 's in hull because she says staff believed she was a boy and she had been using the women 's toilets mcdonald said she was being disruptive it 's time to stop panicking about imaginary fears and focus on the very real violence and discrimination gender variant people face every day but the op - ed brings up an interesting point if trans people have been using bathrooms without issue for years why then create gender - neutral bathrooms this presents a bit of an issue in new york they recognize 31 genders so they can not just say use whatever bathroom you like because some people do not identify as male or female and the law states that they need to accommodate all genders so many institutions have been creating gender - neutral facilities but if it 's true that trans people can and have been using any bathroom why do we need gender - neutral facilities all this does is put biological males and biological females in the same place and then as we have seen from the data from the sunday times it results in women facing assault harassment voyeurism at least that 's what they are reporting but there is an argument as to why we do need gender - neutral bathrooms the high profile stories that we have heard and the debate over whether or not trans people have a right to use bathrooms has led to people being falsely accused of being the wrong sex in this story lesbian made to leave toilet after police refused to believe she 's a woman a video that appears to show a lesbian woman in the u.s . being forcibly removed from a ladies toilet because the police present were not convinced she was female has had more than 2.3 million views since being uploaded to facebook bloggers tomorrow mcdaniel published a video below which has guard more than 5,000 comments since it was posted online in the video the unnamed woman tries to convince the two male officers and one female officer present that she is a woman her friends shatner support she 's a girl which the officers ignored the police then asked the man for identification to prove her sex she rejects their demand offended the male officers then man handler out of the restroom whilst calling her sir the police eventually tell the woman 's friends who are still vouching for her female identity you can all leave if you want if we have bathrooms that are just for males and just for females we do face a challenge when we try to open them up to everybody in north carolina a person who is biologically female was kicked out of mcdonald 's because they do not believe she biologically female we can not punish people simply because they do not look the way we think they should look we can not throw out a feminine man or a masculine woman because we think they might be the other gender because then what are they supposed to do if we are trying to say that only males and only females can be in a particular bathroom",0.4544,"hr 1 the for the people act which includes historic expansions of voter registration and access as well as a major rewrite of campaign finance laws the measure would have had no prior even if it had past illegal immigrants and indeed non - citizens as a whole are not legally able to participate in federal elections but republicans had hoped to send a message to localities such as san francisco where non - citizens are now allowed to vote in school board elections it sounds like i am making it up what kind of government would cancel the vote of its own citizens and replace it with non - citizens said representative dan crenshaw texas republican he pointed to last year 's vote when 49 democrats joined the gop to decry non citizen voting on friday just six democrats voted in favor a 1996 federal law prohibits non - citizens from voting in federal elections but there is no prohibition on localities and indeed a number of jurisdictions allow it to some extent famously liberal takoma park a small jurisdiction in maryland has for several decades allowed non - citizens including illegal immigrants to vote in local elections experts say as many as 40 states or territories allowed non citizen voting back to the nation 's founding san francisco in july began allowing non - citizens to vote in school board elections though they must be parents or legal guardians of students in response to this dan crenshaw tweeted today i offered a motion to recommit hr 1 reaffirming that only us citizens should have the right to vote democrats rejected it next time you go to the ballot box keep that in mind the future of their party is in cities like san francisco where illegals can vote let that sink in this story in january was very alarming to many people from usa today texas top elections officer 95,000 non - citizens found on state voter rolls texas officials are contacting county election authorities statewide to determine whether people who are not us citizens are registering and illegally voting the announcement was decried by voting rights advocate as a thinly veiled effort to purge the registration rolls and to discourage participation at the ballot box texas secretary of state whitley the state 's top election official said his office had been working with the texas department of public safety seeking to determine whether non - citizens are participating in texas elections through this evaluation the texas secretary of state 's office discovered that a total of approximately 95,000 individuals identified by dps as us citizens have a matching voter registration record in texas approximately 58,000 of whom have voted in one or more texas elections however there was some pushback beth stevens voting rights legal director with the texas civil rights project called whitley 's move alarming there is no credible data that indicates illegal voting is happening in any significant numbers and the secretary statement does not change that fact stephen said notably texas has one of the largest numbers of naturalizations in the united states with about 50,000 texas residents becoming naturalized citizens each year she headed weather updates to the legal status of the persons on the secretary 's list has been taken into account is unclear and based on the number of naturalizations in texas every month highly suspect now here 's the conundrum many people on the right feel that there are illegal immigrants voting especially in federal elections as well as local elections they are concerned because it has been reported that newly naturalized immigrants tend to vote democrat the idea is if you allow non - citizens to vote they will support the rival party but more importantly they will vote against the interest of actual citizens think about it if you did allow non - citizens to vote they will vote for their best interest it 's the only thing they can do everyone would well non - citizens would continue to vote to empower non - citizens which would just open the door for anyone to come in and vote and it would essentially destabilize the system of voting in its entirety but the democrats view it as unfair because you have some people in this country who are not citizens but still pay taxes and they say no taxation without representation therefore these people should be allowed to vote and we have seen a couple jurisdictions in the news over the past year pushing for new rules to allow non - citizens to vote for instance mayor and council are pushing to give non - citizens the right to vote in portland this is in maine and there was this story which was referenced by the washington times san francisco will allow non - citizens to vote in a local election creating a new immigration flashpoint there was also concern that illegal immigrants were now going to be allowed to vote in california in federal elections that 's not true but there is some legitimate concern here from snopes they asked california has passed a law allowing undocumented residents to vote and they call it a mixture which is really surprising california do not do that but they have implemented a law providing for the automatic voter registration of motorists who obtain or renew driver 's licenses critics contend that the law will make it easier for non - citizens to unlawfully vote and interestingly snopes recognizes that 's a legitimate concern from critics they called the story a mixture which was surprising to me there is an increasing concern when you have democratic socialists becoming congress women and these people these activists have advocated for open borders you are seeing whole states sanctuary states you are seeing many of these politicians refuse to cooperate with immigrations and customs enforcement and you are seeing many of the newly elected far - left democrats say abolish ice all of these things are grains of sand that make a heap to use an analogy i use all the time when you put them all together it really does seem like the democrats are advocating for open borders now are they coming out and saying we do not want any borders they are not they are actually pushing back against that but there is some interesting nuance here this article from the national review the left 's next target non citizen voting and this article is really interesting because it talks about how it 's actually fairly recent that non - citizens can not vote but times change so let us read why they think it 's wrong today in the story they say non citizen voting was actually the status quo for much of us history it was not until 1926 that arkansas became the last state to ban non - citizens from voting and 1928 that the first federal election without enfranchised aliens occurred since article 1 of the constitution provides that those who can vote in elections for the most numerous house of their state legislature may vote in elections for the house of representatives many congresses in our history have seen members elected from constituencies with significant populations of alien voters initially after the ratification of the constitution congress promoted alien voting partly as an incentive for the settlement of new territories section 11 of the northwest ordinance of 1787 provided that ownership of 50 acres of land and two years residents in the district shall be necessary to qualify a man as elector of a representative regardless of citizenship status alien suffrage peaked in the years after the civil war at least 22 states and territories allowed non citizen voting around 1875 in my home state of south carolina the post - civil war constitution of 1865 joined those of a number of other southern states in allowing aliens who had declared their intent to become citizens to vote as property qualifications fell away and women won the right to vote non citizen voting became more controversial the rising tide of nationalist sentiment during world war one ultimately brought the practice to an end meanwhile voting rights worked spanning across the country to varying degrees and would further expand later in the 20th century with the rightly celebrated voting rights act of 1965 and bills to provide better access to voting for uniformed service members abroad among various other civil rights bills but throughout the voting rights debates of the civil rights era alien voting remained a fringe concept relegated only to the most left - leaning jurisdictions new york allowed aliens to vote in certain school board elections in 1968 but few municipalities followed suit after the issue was taken up as a left - wing cause in the 1990s we ended up pretty much where we are today with around a dozen different jurisdictions across maryland california illinois and new york offering non - citizens and even illegal immigrants access to the ballot the important point in that story is that while it may be alarming to hear a lot of news about different jurisdictions trying to grant non - citizens the right to vote it 's actually existed in this country basically forever although we have mostly done away with it as they point out in the national review there still are some jurisdictions that do allow it now it would seem the national review is very much opposed to the idea as they point out times are different today and i would say i have to agree it 's very different when you have an open frontier and wide uncontrolled spaces and you do not know who is or is not a citizen it 's also different when back then someone could say they were and you do not really know for sure because you do not have computers or databases communications technology has made things very very different and also as population expands and resources become more constrained it becomes more important to make sure we regulate the flow of people coming into another country at least that 's my opinion i do not think i am the smartest person in the world and i do not have all the answers but i have seen many smart people contend even bernie sanders that unchecked migration is bad for the lower class if bernie sanders in 2015 says that open borders is a coke brothers proposal because they just want cheap labor that i have to wonder where the sentiment has gone today when you now have democratic socialists actually holding up signs saying no borders when you actually have activists and politicians saying that non - citizens should vote and that they should not cooperate with immigrations and customs enforcement something has definitely changed in this country i mean the fact that donald trump got elected when no one thought he would and he 's an outlier the fact that bernie sanders is one of the most popular politicians these people are not the establishment they are not the norm and something weird is happening between the parties and the culture where we now have people on the left advocating for unperson a or book - burning or censorship and it 's the right to where it 's inverted now and people on the right are opposing these ideas and that may not be true it may not be true that always the people on the right were opposed to the free flow of information but at least that 's how our culture characterized it when you look at old tv shows like the simpsons i will limit your think in the comments below we will keep the conversation going how do you feel about the issue of non citizen voting and do you think the democrats are wrong to push this bill do you agree with our presentative dan crenshaw let me do not you think you can follow me on mines at tim cast stay tuned new videos every day at 4:00 p.m. eastern on this channel and i will see you at 6 p.m. eastern on my second channel youtube.com slash tim katz news where i will have more videos thanks for hanging out and i will see you all next time",0.6259,hello to everyone watching and listening i recently wrote and recorded a conservative manifesto and released that on youtube these are two appendices to that document which provides some additional information on poverty and inequality and on responsibility and meaning and so all leap right into them with your forbearance and interest appendix one on poverty and inequality and their nature and amelioration it is of crucial importance that conservatives understand and discuss the true nature of material privation and the unequal distribution of both resources and rewards absolute poverty per se is not primarily the consequence of individual sin or the corruption of social systems it is instead a brute and irreducible fact of nature all living things are fated to exert costly effort and garner expendable resources to survive thus the poverty that must be overcome so that privation pain and death can be kept at bay and reproduction insured is not most fundamentally or properly attributed to the exploitation of one individual by another or the corruption and oppression of social institutions the overcoming of dire want in the first place is to be regarded instead as unlikely and as the direct result of laudable personal endeavor and functional and sustainable social enterprise all the same is true of relative poverty the equally brute fact of disproportionate gain and loss is neither attributable in the most fundamental sense to the inadequacies of individual aim or the insufficiency of communal institution it is instead something deeply and mysteriously built into the structure of natural reality itself both natural and social it characterizes the distribution of matter within galaxies a small number of stars have most of the mass the movement of water within ecosystems a small number of rivers carry most of the world 's water the habitation of people within geographical regions a small number of cities have the majority of people the severity of natural disasters a small number of earthquakes destroy the most buildings and the distribution of natural resources a small number of oil fields have most of the deposits the same principle applies to performance and the receipt of attendant rewards within social domains a small number of classical composers wrote all the music of the common classical repertoire scientific endeavors a small fraction of scientists published the majority of scientific papers a small number of scientific papers accrue the majority of citations and book sales a small number of authors dominate the best seller charts this inequality exists equally on the production side in that a small number of people in every enterprise undertake the vast bulk of the valuable work and on the compensation side in that a small number of people garner most of the income and wealth a diverse range of natural processes and every known productive and creative endeavor produces an inequality that must therefore be both recognized and managed neither the fact of such facts which are a small fraction of the full domain of such facts nor the active reference to such facts constitutes any justification for the existence of relative poverty any more than the fact that absolute privation is justified by the a priori reality of its existence they are recognized and cited instead to ensure that the reality of inequality and the difficulty of its amelioration is both recognized and taken with sufficient seriousness rather than say attributed unthinkingly and so dangerously to say the mere fact of capitalism or the inadequacy of democracy or free markets it is also true and needs to be said that the willingness and ability to exploit however motivated and the degeneration and corruption of social systems from the family through the state and church can of course interfere with or even destroy the necessary trust and attitudes and practices that underlie a sustainable productive generous citizenry and community but and it bears repeating that in no wise means that such desire decay and interference is the root cause of the most fundamental economic problems that beset ourselves and our institutions individual ambition and action rightly manifest and social institution properly established and maintained instead produce and distribute abundantly and generously and are compromised in those functions by greed resentment nihilistic faithlessness and confusion and the political economic sociological and theological consequences of those pathologies of motivation the fact of a priori deprivation and the operation of deep laws of unequal production distribution and compensation means that individuals and societies alike must structure themselves so that productive people have the freedom to be productive and are optimally incentivized to continue producing however it is incumbent upon conservatives to appreciate in the deepest sense possible the catastrophe of absolute need and the danger and potential tragedy and social danger of radical inequality to sympathize with the plight of those afflicted by such realities and to note the danger posed to community order by unchecked disparity of ownership and opportunity those who abide by the western canon must therefore support and work for the existence of a plethora of productive enterprises so that many people can strive hopefully for success in many different directions and as well must also strive to foster promote and maintain an ethic and culture of productive generosity this best ensures a place for everyone regardless of the vagaries of innate ability as well as the proper taking of responsibility for and atonement in the face of absolute and relative poverty we are all fated to both arbitrary and unequal degrees of deprivation and privilege some are born poor dim and unhealthy others rich in both resource and opportunity as well as ability and health the proper response to such apparent injustice of placement is in the first place forbearance and gratitude manifested courageously and in the second cultivation of the desire and ability to employ those unequally distributed talents and gifts in the service of the poor downtrodden marginalized and infirm such service satisfies the demands of both conscience and state in the truest and most long lasting senses such service also serves as the most valid and reliable source of the meaning that most truly sustains us all protecting us from despair individually and collectively as we find ourselves exposed to the dramatic and challenging vicissitudes of fate it is truly better to give than to receive and conservatives would do well to balance their demands for liberty autonomy and tradition with the pledge to be caring generous and charitable appendix 2 on personal responsibility and the practicalities of meaning in the absence of deep sustaining meaning the tragedy and betrayal that inevitably accompany life undermines motivation engendering a suffering that can be unbearable and tempting us all toward hedonism cynicism hopelessness bitterness envy and ultimately the delights of vengeful cruelty that meaning has become questionable not least in the aftermath of the philosophical and theological confusion manifesting itself as the death of god young and old alike have become ignorant of their heritage skeptical of the benefits of adulthood unsupported in their agency accused of prejudice and unseemly ambition and fed a continual diet of apocalyptic doom and historical guilt they have become inconsequence dangerously demoralized despite the wealth and security of the present day and the vast horizons of opportunity now available to everyone this most unsettling of conditions and genders and increasing distrust as the worth of human endeavor becomes questionable and the motivations of others the target of increasing suspicion this manifests itself as a dangerous and accelerating polarization as shared aims disintegrate and claims of corruption exploitation and victimization multiply conservatives can offer not only a philosophical and theological alternative to the deterioration of faith producing such distrust and suspicion but a practical guide to the ordering of life such that its suffering might remain tolerable and its stability and adventure sufficient the values of maturity responsibility duty tradition commitment industriousness and civic engagement are now criticized and rejected deemed anachronistic even pilloried regarded as problem not solution treated as unvirtuous and exploitative they are in fact the opposite the daily virtues of attitude and habit that stabilize provide hope and unify that offer a true and time - tested and immediately implementable antidote to the anomy of moral relativism cultural dissolution philosophical ignorance and personal confusion maturity sacrifice and resistance to temptation [ music ] the ability to delay gratification is the hallmark of maturity and a crucial part of the process of adapting to the reality of the future as present actions have future consequences and to the complexities that emerge from the necessity of adjusting short - term individual needs to the demands of sophisticated social reciprocity this means that we must each undertake to bear difficult burdens in the present to ensure the survival of our future selves and equally and similarly our families and communities now and later that maturity can well be recognized and promoted by conservatives as the appropriate and admirable goal of childhood and adolescent development as a state of being preferable to those early stages of development as a respectable valid and worthwhile ambition for development and as a precondition for the establishment of complex productive social institutions marriage the idea that sexual intimacy is best contained within the confines of a stable relationship that a man and a woman should come together as a permanent unit and the children require a minimum of two opposite sex parents for optimal development is a notion as close to universally human as any so far discovered distributed and established marriage provides each individual with the opportunity for true intimacy physical and spiritual the possibility of genuine elevating communication and psychological development a solid platform from which to engage in the challenge of raising children and the profound satisfaction of engaging in a difficult worthwhile mature enterprise a culture firmly based on the principle of stable monogamy is less prone to hyper - competitive youthful male aggression often manifested as a consequence of jealousy loneliness and existential frustration provides women with the stability necessary to dare pregnancy and the vulnerability associated with the care of young children and offers to boys and girls appropriate role models for the development of a stable identity and pattern for adulthood conservatives should be forthright in their admiration for and promotion of this most fundamental of social arrangements all other options however desirable in principle however associated with some hypothetical utopia as doomed at minimum to comparative and perhaps unforeseeable dire failure this does not mean that alternative arrangements whether formulated by necessity or desire should be carelessly opportunistically or cruelly devalued it does mean even given that caveat that the gold standard of permanent traditional monogamous relationships should be broadly socially recognized and rewarded [ music ] a man or loyal caring parents reliable true and honest brothers and sisters and children bonded in love in mutual regard is an individual valued celebrated supported remembered and respected we all therefore need to be encouraged to work with good will and honest courage to value mend and maintain our relationships with our sons and daughters fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters to stabilize and strengthen our families and to make of them veritable pillars of the broader community conservatives can and should discuss and publicly and explicitly support the attitudes and actions necessary to foster such familial integration and should strive to do so in the absence of a compromising doubt or guilt the actions necessary to unify families and make them strong in the face of adversity are fundamentally akin to those that also make for reliable productive social institutions at levels of social organization that surround and subsume the intimate and personal proper and caring practice at the local level thus property prepares us all for proper and caring practice among our friends neighbors colleagues and fellow citizens there is nothing in any of that to justify a corrosive doubt or undermining guilt friendship every individual is well served and well supported by a network of friends united in good faith aiming at the mutual good capable of providing reassurance in times of tragedy and betrayal able and willing to honestly celebrate in times of success and triumph such friendships can neither be established or sustained in consequence of dominance force and compulsion but by the spirit of reciprocity and voluntary play the hallmark of the most productive stable and desirable forms of human social organization people surrounded by friends who genuinely want the best for them but who stand by them equally during times of uncertainty confusion cynicism and despair are in a much more stable position existentially psychologically and practically are much less likely to drown in chaos and much more likely to maintain and flourish in an optimal order societies composed of individuals ensconced within such friendships are more likely to be stable productive charitable and generous employment work job or career is socially valued productive activity most typically a sacrifice of present impulse to the broader community and the future it is necessary to say it again not because one class or sex or race dominates another but because privation is the basic condition of life and effort must be expanded to address it work is often viewed cynically as a curse or as an indication of exploitation and victimhood and can indeed make itself manifest in the form of degrading unsustainable and hopeless toil under optimal conditions however both psychological and social work is a blessing not simply because absolute poverty can be ameliorated through effort but because genuine and sustaining meaning can be found in a task well and faithfully undertaken even at the most basic level of participation in an enterprise or endeavor work properly undertaken can offer the opportunity for genuine social contribution the possibility of establishing lasting friendships and working relationships the opportunity for learning and growth personal and practical the provision of rewards attendant upon participation in a worthwhile valuable enterprise and the experience necessary for informed and skillful movement forward into broader more complex sophisticated productive and generous endeavor conservatives can make a case for work can nest that case within their efforts to uphold justify and promote free markets can endeavor to make the rules governing work just and fair and arranged so that commitment effort and merit are rewarded appropriately sustainably and justly civic engagement the stability of state and country is in the final analysis dependent on the integrity of the individual and the family the local civic level functions as a necessary intermediary participation in small - scale local institutions which is often where real valuable and necessary fortification and change occurs is therefore another necessary precondition for psychological health social unity and productive piece sports teams book and drama clubs charitable foundations business organizations political parties and churches synagogues and mosques all offer social value and the sense of genuine contribution that interpersonal communion and mature and voluntary service to others inevitably provides conservatives can remind the alienated and lost that the many serious problems that need to be solved and the many enjoyable games that could conceivably be played provide a horizon of opportunity dependent only on pure willingness to engage conservatives could invite the disaffected young and old alike to make their services available so that the community could benefit and those offering welcomed recognized and valued accomplishment ambition in the highest and truest sense is the motivation to move forward in the face of difficulty disappointment frustration privation tragedy betrayal and malevolence and to engage in life courageously honestly productively and generously this is the wish and the willingness to develop genuine competence not the striving for narcissistic self - gratification and not the expression of the will to dominate exploit and oppress the desire for accomplishment is in its deepest manifestation the motivation to first see and then traverse the path that provides the best for all at all levels of ability and opportunity it is the instinct to engage in and value such accomplishment that is part of our most admirable moral sense ambition itself seen in this light is nothing less than the entirely admirable desire to reduce unnecessary pain and suffering to promote a sustainable happiness and to create the wealth and prosperity that makes for security opportunity and further adventure it is better to give than to receive for these reasons as well as those previously delineated and the purest and most admirable form of accomplishment is more for all in a manner simultaneously just sustainable and generous every person does not have to participate in every social institution or social action but it is a rare person indeed who can live without a degenerating misery and cynicism in the absence of all activities and social bonds this does not mean that creative exception even rejection when required of certain otherwise self - evidently necessary social norms is either unnecessary or without value it does mean however that the creative production that does not merely and heedlessly decimate and destroy must be undertaken within a broader framework of shared assumption perception and action of shared bedrock value the conservatives desiring to uphold and promote the canon of western values can therefore offer to all those who are hopeless and lost even if they are truly exceptional the purpose adventure and support to be found in striving forward in all these varied domains of traditional endeavor that practical orientation and accomplishment constitutes the most reliable bulwark against the oft otherwise demoralizing tragedies betrayals disappointments and grievous losses that characterize human all to human conception and existence that practical orientation provision of hope and stabilization serves as the genuine antidote to the despair and bitterness that can undermine all hope engender accrual and vindictive resentment and dangerously destabilize and threaten society itself thank you all for watching and listening i have just read the appendices to a conservative manifesto,0.4953,there are numerous different interpretations of christianity the bible who jesus is and what being a quote real christian means some people believe that the bible is 100 % historical and literal while others view the scriptures as allegorical or mythological or a blend of history and mythology but still conveying a divine message from god by symbolically representing spiritual sociological and psychological laws of the universe but most christians believe that faith in jesus that he is god in human form and he paid the penalty for your sins accepting the punishment on your behalf along with genuine repentance regret or remorse for your sins is the only way to have salvation and come into fellowship with god and the entire premise of christianity is that it 's by faith alone belief not rituals or works or outside actions or anything that you can do such as being a good person so no one can boast that they have more favorability with god than others and this salvation certainly is not contingent on anyone 's ancestry or what ethnic group you belong to jesus offers fellowship with god and access to the kingdom of heaven to all of mankind jew and gentile meaning non - jew also called or goyam which is a disparaging term used by some jews to refer to non - jews judaism on the other hand is a very exclusive and ethnocentric religion notice jews do not try to preach or spread the word to others about their god because to them he 's their god and they are his special people in fact they discourage people who are not born ethnically jewish from converting to judaism and many converts still are not considered jews according to jewish law because if their mother is not an ethnic jew then they are not really seen as jewish because they have no direct genetic lineage to the ancient israelites this is why some people accuse some jews of being jewish supremacists which of course is denounced as another anti - semitic slur because white people are the only ethnic group that are supposed to supposedly see themselves or be framed as being superior to others in the talid the recorded oral teachings of jewish religious leaders known as rinic judaism which has been the mainstream form of judaism the religion since the 6th century it not only says that jesus was a false messiah and a blasphemer who the pharisees proudly put to death but that mary was a and an adulterous who had sex with a roman soldier named panthera and that 's how she became pregnant with jesus the book jesus in the talmid which was written by a jewish religious scholar at princeton university whose name is peter schaefer is probably the best summary of the jewish view on jesus in print today because the talid itself as a whole is many many volumes the talmid is considered to be just as sacred as the hebrew bible the old testament by most jews most christians however are not even aware of the talid and are quite shocked to learn what it says about jesus and that it is one of the most sacred religious texts of modern judaism and the single most influential document in the history of judaism now if an ethnic jew who once followed religious judaism an orthodox jew the ones who wear the amica becomes a follower of jesus a christian believing in jesus they are often called a messianic jew to make the distinction that while they have jewish heritage ethnicity they also are a christian now jesus came to fulfill the old testament prophecies of a messiah a savior and essentially reform or transform judaism much like buddha reformed hinduism by preaching his formula for en enen to all breaking the monopoly held by the religious leaders at the time in india the brahman who saw themselves as the authorities others needed to rely on in order to gain knowledge of god with the coming of jesus the messiah jews were invited into god 's new covenant which was also offered to all of mankind so they could do away with the external rituals and other stringent practices they previously used in hopes of becoming holy and pleasing pleasing to god instead they could now be guided by faith alone through a spiritual transformation of their mind which automatically changes how they think and behave bringing them into harmony with god through the holy spirit a supernatural force that functions as an invisible guide in conscience but the bible makes it clear that many jews were jealous of their chosenness over the gentiles the non - jews being offered communion with the god of israel who they saw as their god the god of ethnic jews but by god becoming a man in the form of jesus he provided a way for humans to better understand him and to relate to him he came to earth not only to reveal his instructions through parables that any man woman and child could understand but to set an example for how to think and how to behave to be the ultimate role model and when the holy spirit enters a person 's mind through belief in christ it 's like downloading a new operating system for your computer or your phone and the old animalistic carnal human nature is upgraded and one becomes a spiritual being 2 corinthians 5:17 says therefore if anyone is in christ the new creation has come the old is gone and the new is here there are many metaphors that describe this perhaps the most common is a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly christians use the term born again to signify this transformation and jesus enables us to inter face with the awesome and inconceivable power of god in a way that our limited brains can comprehend anyone who rejects christ as the son of god the light of the world the transmission of god 's messages to mankind also rejects god john 2:23 so jews who do not believe in jesus are not god 's chosen people not anymore not since the new covenant the arrival of jesus christians are god 's chosen people this is supersessionism because christians superseded jews as god 's covenanted people it 's often called replacement theology as a major of and it 's considered heresy by many churches today because they do not want to be accused of anti - semitism although the bible makes it very clear that christians are god 's chosen people and ever since the early days of christianity christians were universally understood to be just that until zionism became a major influence in christianity zionism is the belief in the political movement that promotes the idea that israel should be a country exclusively for jews while all western democracies such as the united states and all countries throughout europe are under strict demands to surrender their ethnic majorities by embracing multiculturalism through mass immigration and the importation of other non - white ethnic groups galatians 3:23 also makes it clear that if you belong to christ then you are abraham 's seed and hs according to the promise and your personal salvation and relationship with christ has nothing to do whatsoever with two different ethnic groups jews and palestinians fighting over a plot of land,0.7915,to say that the democratic party is in a complete state of chaos would be an understatement in 2016 as we all know the dnc cheated bernie sanders out of the nomination to nominate a wildly unpopular candidate hillary clinton who went on to lose the general election and today we are still seeing absolute chaos and the dnc is now being exposed plotting a way to steal the election from bernie sanders but weights of course the media is still going after trump were not done but the latest story from politico shows that michael bloomberg who bought his way into the democratic debate has been privately lobbying the moderate democrats to support him in the event of a brokered convention right now the latest 5:38 prediction model shows that no one will win the democratic nomination that is the most likely outcome so bloomberg is rallying the democratic establishment to steal it away from bernie sanders even if he gets the popular vote in the primary because as far as anyone 's as far as anyone can tell as far as i can tell the democratic nominating process is rigged to allow high - profile elites to decide who the nominee will be now for all the things i disagree with bernie sanders on the one thing we agree on is that if he wins the vote he should be their nominee but of course the dnc has the delegate process and the super delegate second round michael bloomberg is hoping to exploit this so that at the dnc at the democratic national convention the moderates will all side with him and push out bernie sanders boy can you imagine the absolute chaos in the streets of milwaukee at the dnc when bernie sanders gets robbed again now there is some good reasons why the democrats are rejecting bernie sanders his policies are not very popular outside of urban centers and the guy just had a heart attack but now we are seeing another thing that 's very interesting because the cheating in my opinion extends beyond just bernie sanders they are actually just going after the populist in general they hate donald trump much the same but they also hate michael bloomberg for some reason there is no unity in the democratic party it is absolute chaos and the media can not decide who to smear trump or bloomberg so let us break this the first thing i want to do is show you the story and explain to you how the establishment is going to steal the nomination from bernie and then i want to show you how they are going to try and smear and discredit donald trump we will see how things play out the first story from politico bloomberg quietly plotting brokered convention strategy the efforts effort is designed as a political backstop to block bernie sanders by poaching supporters from joe biden and other moderates now before we read on make sure you head over to tim cast comm slash donut if you 'd like to support my work there 's many ways you can give but the best thing you can do is share this video there 's going to be important news for bernie sanders supporters i 'd imagine so if you find yourself on the left you should pay attention to this this is how they are going to steal it from bernie sanders now again i think there 's good reasons why they are scared of a bernie sanders nomination all that really matters and here 's the bad news for you on the left and the democrats you are going to lose to donald trump now the media is trying to smear smear the president but the fact that the democratic party is fractured this heavily and the fact that no matter who gets nominated there have a bunch of weaknesses and pitfalls show is that trump is walking into a winning fight but again sharing this video could help break some echo chambers and for the rest of you i noticed many people have not subscribed if you like this video and want to see more please subscribe to this channel hit that notification battle so that youtube will finally start telling you and i have videos because they do not let us read the story from politico they report michael bloomberg is privately lobbying democratic party officials and donors a light with his moderate opponents to flip their allegiance to him and block bernie sanders in the event of a brokered national convention the effort largely executed by bloomberg 's senior state level advisors in recent weeks attempts to prime a bloomberg for a second ballot contest at the democratic national convention in july by poaching supporters of joe biden and other moderate democrats according to two democratic strategists familiar with the talks and unaffiliated with bloomberg now it would be i believe it 's fair to say what bloomberg is plotting here is not overt cheating like the brokered convention,1.0714,"okay number one the dossier compiled by christopher steel the steel dossier on behalf of the democratic national committee and the hillary clinton campaign formed an essential part of the carter page 5s application steel was a longtime fbi source who was paid over $ 160,000 by dnc and clinton campaign bein lawfirm perkins coie and research firm fusion gps to obtain derogatory information on donald trump 's ties to russia neither the initial application in october 2016 nor any of the renewals disclosed or reference the role of the dnc clinton campaign or any party or campaign in funding steele efforts even though the political origins of the steel dossier were then known to senior doj and fbi officials the initial fisa application notes steele was working for a named us person but does not name fusion gps or principal glenn simpson who was paid by us law firm representing the dnc even though that was known by the doj at the time the application does not mention steel was ultimately working on behalf of them and paid for by the dnc and clinton campaign or the fbi had separately authorized payments to steel for the same information so that 's the big point here right is that the the dossier was the basis for the fisa warrant and that was the basis for launching the entire investigation to the carter page fisa application also cited extensively a september 23rd 2016 yahoo news article by michael isikoff which focuses on pages july 2016 trip to moscow this article does not corroborate the steel dossier because it is derived from information leaked by steele himself to yahoo news the page fisa application incorrectly assesses that still did not directly provide information to yahoo news steel has admitted in british court filings he met with yahoo news and several other outlets in september 2016 at the direction of fusion gps perkins coie was aware of steele 's initial media context because they hosted at least one meeting in washington dc in 2016 with steel infusion gps where this matter was discussed so they are knocking down the assumption that there was other information used for the carter page warrant right because the carter page application originally included this yahoo news article by michael isikoff but that was coming from the same place namely christopher steel steel was suspended and then terminated as an fbi source for what the fbi defines the most serious of violations an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his relationship with the fbi then on october 30th 2016 mother jones article by david corn steele should have been terminated for his previous undisclosed contact with yahoo and other outlets in september before the fisa application before the was it before the page application was sent to the court in october but still improperly concealed from and lied to the fbi about those contacts so they are now suggesting when steele should be prosecuted for lying to the fbi steele 's numerous encounters with the media by the cardinal rule of source handling maintaining confidentiality and demonstrated that steel had become a less than reliable source for the fbi before and after steel was terminated as a source he maintained contact with the doj via then associate deputy attorney general bruce or a senior doj official who works closely with deputy attorneys general y 8 m later rosenstein shortly after the election the fbi began interviewing or documenting his communications with steel for example in september 2016 i am reading directly from this fabled four page memo put out by devin nunes steele admitted to or his feelings against then - candidate trump when steele said he was quote desperate that donald trump not get elected and was passionate about him about not being president now there she waits to read that one steele thought that trump was actually in bed with the russians and do not want him to be president or two he hated trump and therefore trumped up all this stuff against trump this clear evidence of steele 's bias was recorded by or at the time and subsequently an official fbi files been not reflected in any of the page fisa applications during the same period or his wife this is a deputy attorney general was employed by fusion gps to assist in the cultivation of opposition research on trump or later provided the fbi with all of his wife 's apple research paid for by the dnc and clinton campaign via effusion gps the orr 's relationship with steel and fusion gps was inexplicably concealed from the fisa court so all of this smells terrible all of this is super super dirty stuff and in just a second we are going to go through the rest of the memo and we are going to get trump 's reaction to all of this it sounds like he 's preparing for mass firings so things are about to heat up in a serious way we will get to all of that in just one second first i want

of the second trimester which at the time corresponded to the point at which a fetus was sought to achieve viability i.e the ability to survive outside the womb although the court acknowledged that states had a legitimate interest in protecting potential life it found that this interest could not justify any restrictions on pre and pre - viability abortions the court did not explain the basis for this line even abortion supporters have found it hard to defend rose reasoning one prominent constitutional scholar wrote he would vote for a statute very much like the one the court ended up drafting if he were a legislator but his assessment of roe was memorable and brutal roe was not constitutional law at all and gave almost no sense of an obligation to try to be the person who wrote that was john hart eli at the time of roe 30 states still prohibited abortion at all stages in the years prior to that decision about a third of the states had liberalized their laws but will abruptly ended that political process it imposed the same highly restrictive regime on the entire nation it effectively struck down the abortion laws of every single state as justice byron white aptly put it in his descent the decision represented the exercise of raw judicial power and in sparked a national controversy that has embittered our political culture for half a century eventually right toledo and planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania versus casey in 1992 the court revisited roe but the members of the court split three ways two justices expressed no desire to change their own anyway for others wanted to overrule the decision in its entirety the three remaining justices who jointly signed the controlling opinion took a third position their opinion did not endorse rose reasoning it even hinted that one or more of its authors might have reservations about whether the constitution protects a right to abortion but the opinion concluded that starry decisis precedent which calls for prior decisions to be followed in most instances required adherence to what it called rose central holding that a state may not constitutionally protect fetal life before viability even if that holding was wrong anything less the opinion claimed would undermine respect for the court and the rule of law paradoxically the judgment in case he did a fair amount of overruling several important abortion decisions were overruled in total role itself was overruled in part casey threw out rose trimester scheme and substituted a new rule of uncertain origin under which states were forbidden to adopt any regulation that imposed an undue burden on a woman 's right to have an abortion the decision provided no clear guidance about the difference between a do and an undue burden but the three justices who authored the controlling opinion called the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by treating the court 's decision as the final settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion s has become increasingly apparent in the intervening years casey did not achieve that goal under statement of the year there from justice alito americans continue to hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion state legislatures have acted accordingly some have recently enacted laws allowing abortion with few restrictions at all stages of pregnancy others have tightly restricted abortion beginning well before viability in this case 26 states have expressly asked the court to overrule roe and casey and allow the states to regulate or prohibit pre - viability abortion before us now is one such state law the state of mississippi asks us to uphold the constitutionality of a law that generally prohibits an abortion after the 15th week of pregnancy several weeks before the point at which a fetus is now regarded as viable outside the womb in defending this law the state 's primary argument is that we should reconsider an overrule roe and casey and once again allow each state to regulate abortion as its citizens wish on the other side respondents and the solicitor general that 's the biden administration or the or the um the white house ask us to reaffirm and casey they contend that the mississippi law can not stand if we do so allowing mississippi to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy they argue would be no different than overruling casey and roe entirely they contend no half measures are available and that we must either reaffirm or overrule roe and casey right this was the issue by the way right in the mississippi case basically both sides were arguing the same thing from flip sides the the people who are arguing in favor of the mississippi law said yes we understand that this law challenges roe versus wade and the viability structure of roe versus wade and planned parenthood versus casey we know that you should have a rule row and the left said this this law challenges roe you have to overrule it because it violates roe nobody said you can still uphold row and uphold the law and this meant that the court had to vote one way or the other and apparently they are now going to vote in favor of overrule and grow which of course is the correct decision alito says we hold that roe and casey must be overruled the constitution makes no reference to abortion no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision including the one on which the defenders of roe and casey now chiefly rely the due process clause of the 14th amendment that provision has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the constitution but any such right must be deeply rooted in this nation 's history and tradition and implicit in the concept of order liberally

ukraine continues to deteriorate according to the wall street journal russian forces moved by air and land to attack kieva on friday while the capitals defenders dug into positions along its forested edge and prepared to blow up the bridges at an airfield russian troops who had taken the facility following an airborne assault linked with russian armor troops had poured in from belarus ukrainian soldiers on the front line said with ukrainian artillery and armor dispersed nearby troops including recently enrolled volunteers in civilian dress race for the russian onslaught from the north and west after kiev came under renewed bombardment earlier in the day and president vladimir zielinski vowed not to surrender defenders were gearing up for urban combat gunfire erupted in several kiev neighborhoods and what you ukrainian officials several clashes with russian infiltrators ukrainian artillery and tanks were moving through the city the ukrainian defense ministry has been asking citizens of ukraine to make molotov cocktails on twitter they have now been calling on europeans with any military training to come and help them and pour into ukraine in an attempt to repel the russians casualty figures were unclear zielinski said on friday that 137 people had already been killed other officials put the toll in the hundreds as well kiev was hit by a series of russian airstrikes that shook the city center through the morning after putin ordered an all - out assault on ukraine aimed at toppling in the government of zelensken ending ukraine 's alignment with the west altogether a residential high - rise went up in flames after being hit russia has not gone in full scale with troops at this point because they are attempting to establish air superiority before they allegedly attempt to bring in about 10 000 paratroopers thousands of residents of kiev spent the night in underground subway stations that had been converted into bomb shelters overnight zielinski wearing a military sweatshirt said on friday this morning we are defending our country all alone the most powerful nations of the world are just watching from afar only solidarity and decisiveness by ukrainians will be able to preserve our freedom and our state he also added that he was russia 's principal target as moscow seeks to bring down ukraine 's democratically elected government he said the enemy has marked me as enemy number one they want to destroy ukraine politically by destroying the head of state and this of course aligns with a lot of what we are hearing from intelligence sources that say that the goal here is to decapitate the zelenski administration and then put in place a putin puppet regime in ukraine the same way that they have in places like donetsk and luhansk kremlin spokesman dimitri peskov said on friday moscow recognizes zelensky 's ukraine 's president but was yet to assess a suggestion from kiev maybe it might be willing to begin talks with russia over ukraine adopting neutral status as a country so that is one of the offers that zelenski is now putting on the table he suggested that he would declare ukraine to be non - aligned saying we will formally never attempt to join nato which is what putin had originally said he wanted but now that the troops are on the ground i i think it 's highly unlikely that putin acquiesces to any of these calls for negotiation foreign minister sergey lavrov accused zolensky of lying until the ukrainian president had missed his opportunity when putin previously suggested a non - aligned status lavrov is no longer interested in anything short of zelenski 's head on a platter or at least seeing him locked up in a moscow labor camp according to jazz shaw writing for hot air now putin has gone in too far at this point to simply pull out without any sort of of change in the top level of the administration in ukraine zielinski said they want to destroy ukraine politically by destroying the head of state he said his family was the number two target he said my family is not traitors but citizens of ukraine i have no right to say where they are now he said that enemy sabotage groups had infiltrated the city according to the washington post and that nato and europe had left ukraine alone to defend itself against the russian onslaught and the most dramatic footage of the day came from a place called snake island which is just off the coast of ukraine of course and um apparently there was a an audio exchange as russian warships approached snake island also known as zimini island a russian officer says that this is a military warship this is a russian military warship i suggest you lay down your weapons and surrender to avoid bloodshed and needless casualties otherwise you will be bombed and then a ukrainian soldier comes on the air and says russian warship go f yourself apparently all of the soldiers all the ukrainian soldiers were then summarily killed by the russian forces that are invading said we will give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country be ready to support ukraine in the squares of our city we will lift sanctions on all citizens of ukraine who are ready to defend our country as part of territorial defense with weapons in hand kiev of course has been hit over and over at this point multiple explosions were heard earlier in the day according to the washington post sirens were heard in la viva as well that 's ukraine 's far west and near nato 's eastern flank a senior ukrainian defense official said russian forces were near the town of borzol some 20 miles to kievs at northwest white administration officials told lawmakers late thursday they feared the capital would soon fall with russian mechanized forces that had crossed over from belarus on its outskirts ukrainian president zielinski said thursday he remained in kiev the enemy sabotage groups were already in the capital so things are extraordinarily grim in ukraine it looks as though russia is just days if not hours from taking kiev outright and then presumably killing all of its opponents or sending them to labor camps and putting in place and regime more friendly to its own ambitions one of the things that has happened here is that vladimir putin has shattered a couple of generations with a really really bad foreign policy thing it turns out that some of the dumbest people on earth are the people who make foreign policy for the state department i am talking in bipartisan fashion and this has been true for quite a while the state department is filled with quizzling idiots and it 's always been filled with quizling idiots and it 's not a shock to learn the state department really does not know what it 's doing very often you remember that during the trump administration in the middle east the state department kept suggesting that if for example the u.s embassy in israel was moved to jerusalem that would spark all - out war in the middle east and that peace could never be achieved john kerry former secretary of state said this peace could never be achieved with arab nations without some sort of concessions to the palestinians of course that was the group think at the state department talking and it was completely wrong and there are a number of premises that have been held by idiots at the state department are elites at the state department that are just incredibly wrong and putin proved a bunch of them wrong over the course of the last week number one the idea that economic sanctions deter major military powers from doing anything is wrong and it has been wrong for a very very long time in fact there 's a good new book out titled the economic weapon by a professor at yale university nicholas mulder and that that book is about a history of economic warfare and the use of economic sanctions to try and deter major forces from engaging in warfare and of course it has never worked we have tried economic sanctions against japan it do not work we tried economic sanctions against italy when they invaded ethiopia it do not work we tried economic sanctions against hitler it did not work over and over again we have tried economic sanctions on major powers and and the real fact of the matter is that economic sanctions on major powers are ineffective because those major powers usually are able to avoid those economic sanctions by finding other people to ally with them or align with them if they are a big financial or commercial loopholes then it makes it nearly impossible for sanctions to have any long - term impact and again alliances allow you to skirt all of that which is exactly what russia has known so economic sanctions were bound to be a failure here particularly the sort of economic sanctions that we were laying for russia as we will talk about in just one moment that 's not the only idiotic foreign policy idea that was shattered by vladimir putin 's aggression another idiotic foreign policy idea is that just because you are a second - rate economic power that means that you are not going to be aggressive that 's always been foolish in fact it turns out that countries that are second - rate economic powers have routinely been extraordinarily aggressive on their borders the reason being when you are weak internally this means that you tend to be more aggressive externally in order to lock down your own population and give them some sort of common purpose so everyone was suggesting that because russia has a very weak economy again russia 's total national gdp is approximately the size of the gdp of the state of florida just because of that the idea was well russia presumably would would stop being quite as aggressive why why would we think that,1.0329,i mean why why exactly would he be sitting in the back room think what 's best for kamla what 's best for kamla by the way jill biden hates kla harris a a fact worth noting joe biden despises kla harris ever since the 2020 race in which kla harris basically labeled joe biden both a racist and a according to axios the tensions have been playing out on the staff level two harris 's team has been trying to add staff to the vp 's office to handle the bigger workload it 's been frustrated at the white house 's pace and getting people detailed for that according to two people familiar with the matter the white house has been working to help harris 's team and has been frustrated by some of the rules about who can be detailed and when again the white house is like well you do not do anything as vice president before why are we detailing additional staff to you so you can campaign several biden aids have joined harris 's campaign but some feel like they have been labeled as disloyal by biden team for leaving or even considering it a white house official told axio everyone from the president ton down knows how important the election is we always anticipated a number of staff would want a transition from the administration to the campaign for the final stretch on harris 's campaign there 's also awkwardness between some who are on biden 's original campaign staff and harris allies who 've been installed in recent weeks in the weeks after harris became the democratic nominee there were squabbles about whether biden 's main surrogates on tv would continue in those roles or if new faces would emerge harris 's team prevailed some on harris 's team are weary of the biden campaign crew they are now working with after all biden 's team publicly argued harris was less electable than biden in the weeks after the president 's disastrous debate in june he was deputy campaign manager rob flarity who wrote in a letter quote at the end of the day we 'd switch to candidates who would according to the polls be less likely to win than joe biden the only person ever to defeat donald trump meanwhile white house spokesperson andrew bates told aio president biden endorsed vice president harris immediately after leaving the race rejecting other approaches that would divide the party but again the tensions are quite real the sore feelings are quite real and this is a big big problem for kla harris but the biggest problem is not joe biden and joe biden is a ghost wandering around in this haunted white house but the biggest problem is in fact kla harris as we all know if kla harris were a strong candidate it turns out strong candidates unite weak candidates divide donald trump is a strong candidate he 's united the republican party with all of its disperate factions with all of its multitudinous errors it is a united party behind donald trump because he is in fact a strong figure kla harris is a weak horse and it is dividing the democratic party and independents are quite alienated from kamla harris whom they correctly see as a totally empty vessel the latest example of kamla harris word sading over the weekend she was speaking in greenville and uh and here 's how it went it is it 's easy in these moments of crisis to to question our faith to sometimes lose our faith for a moment because what we see is so hard to see that we lose faith or a vision of those things we can not see but must know what in the world is she talking about what does that even mean she speaks like tanasi coat writes just these long sentences that lead nowhere mix metaphors and do not even make use of proper antecedants it 's wild in fact there 's a full report out that kla harris is now getting helped to clean up her style in interviews after she can not explain how she differs from joe biden apparently this report out from mediaite suggests that vice president harris 's team has been discussing ways to clean up her responses to questions this week about how she would differentiate herself from president joe biden according to four people familiar with the discussions is nbc news reporting harris 's answers including one where she said she could not think of anything,0.9107,but that credit card is predicated on dollar value for example what if you could do transactions with pretty much anyone and you could do it without having to refer to the dollar you would not have to worry about central banks you would not have to worry about government blowing up the value of the currency all that a bitcoin is is a belief that other people are going to use the bitcoin so who created bitcoin supposedly it is this guy right here supposedly his name is satoshi nakamoto now the reason i say supposedly is because nobody actually knows who created bitcoin and supposedly it is this guy who 's supposed to be 40 and from japan that 's kind of awesome because you do not want to have a centralized guy who controls all of bitcoin some mastermind criminal who actually can inflate bitcoin at any point and then sell all of his bitcoin for a bunch of money you want it to be decentralized that is the purpose the basic idea of bitcoin is that you are concerned that this right here the full faith and credit of the united states or any government it does not mean anything right what if you are worried about that what if you are worried that the government can simply devalue dollars well then you need to find another repository of value so what bitcoin is is you believe that the currency is stable enough to be used and enough people are going to accept the currency that it has inherent value instead of you relying on the government 's ability to tax and the government 's ability to stimulate and the government 's ability to print and take out of circulation instead of relying on all of those powers you are relying on the idea that there is something that is trusted by enough people that they will use that in the absence of a government so you are giving up a certain amount of faith in the pure unbridled power of government in favor of faith in other people believing in the same iou notes that you believe in this is why some people like leadership like that 's a pyramid scheme because just like any other temporary repository of value people could fall out of love with bitcoin and that 's true people could fall out of love with bitcoin or they could find a new version of bitcoin you see new sort of currencies springing up every so often so theoretically you could have people decide you know what we do not want to use bitcoin anymore or businesses say we are not going to accept bitcoin as payment anymore and the value could theoretically go to zero that is 100 true it also happens to be the case that bitcoin can not be controlled from the outside because governments can make currencies worth zero but governments do not have the power to make bitcoin worth zero that is because bitcoin is not a centralized currency it is a decentralized cryptocurrency so that comes with some cost and it comes with some benefits on the cost side you can not rely on the ability of bitcoin to give you some sort of hard asset in exchange for your bitcoin because that does not exist that 's not what bitcoin is on the good side of the ledger you do not have to worry that the creators of bitcoin are going to simply inflate the value of bitcoin or deflate the value of bitcoin by simply printing new bitcoin in essence here is sort of the difference between fiat currency and bitcoin fiat currency is a government right called the us government and the u.s government decides the value of the currency and then that value is promulgated to all of the other human beings right these are all the citizens all the citizens are out here yay citizen,2.2067,"let me ask you a question and you can you get answers in the comments do you really like facebook because we usually want to ask people they tell me they hate facebook they do not like the newsfeed that they only really use it for messenger i mean that 's really the only reason i use facebook i do not even have the app on my phone anymore many people have been talking about the demise of facebook saying that this is truly the point at which the platform will slowly die off and the reason for this is that there is a huge backlash following news that cambridge analytical a data firm was using data it was not supposed to have access to the hash tag delete facebook started to trend worldwide many news organizations started to run articles explaining how to deactivate and even delete your facebook account facebook stock then began to fall we saw elon musk announced on twitter that he had deleted tesla and spacex from facebook so certainly there does seem to be a case to state that facebook may be in the decline but new information has just come to light this morning it was announced that playboy was also deleting its facebook page that would affect nearly 25 million fans so let me ask you again how do you feel about facebook and do you think it might actually be dying now in spite of everything i said there are certainly people who think nothing will

deletes its facebook accounts the delete facebook hashtag movement is now in full swing issued a press release late tuesday night to announce its withdrawal from facebook it has deactivated the playboy accounts that playboy enterprise manages directly affecting some 25 million fans according to the company playboy becomes the latest company to join the call to delete facebook after the cambridge analytic a scandal punctuated on friday by elon musk 's order to remove tesla and spacex pages from zuckerberg social media juggernaut the official statement from playboy enterprises inc regarding facebook for years it has been difficult for playboy to express our on facebook due to its strict content and policy guidelines we have been faced with the only alternative being to alter playboy 's voice in order to meet facebook 's views of what is and is not appropriate on its platform while that has challenged our business objectives and the ability to reach our audience in an authentic way the recent news about facebook 's alleged mismanagement of users data has solidified our decision to suspend our activity on the platform at this time there are more than 25 million fans who engage with playboy via our various facebook pages and we do not want to become complicit in exposing them to the reported practices that is why we have announced that we will be leaving facebook 's platform deactivating the playboy accounts that playboy enterprises manages directly playboy has always stood for personal freedom and the celebration of sex today we take another step in that ongoing fight elon musk already gained a ton of attention when he announced tesla and spacex would be removed from the platform from cnbc elon musk facebook gives me the willies friday musk deleted his company facebook pages for both spacex and tesla then on saturday in response to a story from enthusiast site tesla motor club reporting the news musk said deleting the pages was not an effort to make a public comment about facebook nor was it any response to a dare instead he says he deleted the pages for tesla because he does not like the social media behemoth in one tweet stating it 's not a political statement and i do not do this because someone dared me to do it just do not like facebook gives me the willies sorry and in response to venturebeat he said we never advertised with facebook none of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake endorsed product lives or dies on its own merits naturally when you have these high profile facebook deactivations or deletions a lot of people think that the trend is really really powerful and this might be spelling the demise of facebook this follows the delete facebook hashtag trend amid the cambridge analytic a scandal from cbs news a movement called delete facebook has been spreading ever since a whistleblower came forward saying he and a data firm he worked for exploited a loophole in facebook to harvest data from 50 million users even the founder of whatsapp which facebook bought in 2014 for 19 billion dollars tweeted it 's time to delete facebook now elon musk says it was not political he just said facebook gives him the willies now i have a question for you have you ever had a conversation with a friend or gone to the store and look at something and then all of a sudden you see an advertisement for that on facebook many of us have had this experience where facebook will recommend someone and we have no idea how they knew that we were some way connected to that person or an advertisement appeared and we just had no idea how they knew we were thinking about this product sure when you google search something we get that that these websites have cookies and they they track your data to a certain extent but just a few months ago i was at walmart and there was a big tv on display and my brother and i were talking about it we come back home and 10 minutes later my brother got an advertisement for that tv how does something like that happen certainly that 's enough to give people the willies the other day on reddit someone posted this to design they said fb messenger reading my text to shove ads in my face and in their message they said here 's the recipe let me know if you can open this and sure enough there 's an advertisement from food network find recipes in a post from three years ago someone was asking if facebook was reading their private messages because they said one of my friends got banned for 24 hours and received a message from facebook telling him that he was banned because he sent a private message to one of his friends and that the photos violates facebook policies down below someone said same thing has just happened to me a moment ago facebook banned me for posting images seven days because one of the images i sent privately violated facebook policy and these are just anecdotes but these are examples of people feeling like facebook is doing something nefarious that facebook is spying on them what i have talked about in the past few days is that facebook is absolutely collecting data from third parties who never agreed to give that data to facebook now facebook might ask you when you sign up or use their mobile app can they have access to your data and certainly you can allow them to have this access but let us say facebook is tracking your call logs and your text message history the people who are calling you and texting you never agreed to give their metadata to facebook they never agreed to give their phone number to facebook what happens let us say you have 10 people who all know this one person and they all receive phone calls from them facebook now knows who this person called at every point of the day because everyone else is in facebook 's network suffice it to say facebook gives me the willies too according to pj media cambridge analytical whistleblower facebook able to listen to you at home and work cambridge analytical whistleblower christopher wiley appearing before a committee of british mps on tuesday said that facebook has the ability to spy on users in their homes and offices the british parliament is investigating cambridge analytic --iz involvement in the brexit election mp damien collins who chaired the committee asked wiley whether facebook has the ability to listen to what people are talking about in order to better target them with ads there 's been various speculation about the fact that facebook can through the facebook app on your smartphone listen in to what people are talking about and discussing and using that to prioritize the advertising as well colin said other people would say no they do not think it 's possible it 's just that the facebook system is just so good at predicting what you are interested in that it can guess he asked for wiley 's thoughts on the possibility on a comment about using audio and processing audio you can use it for my understanding generally of how companies use it not just facebook but generally other apps that pull audio is for environmental context wiley said so if for example you have a television playing versus if you are in a busy place with a lot of people talking versus a work environment he clarified it 's not to say they are listening to what you are saying it 's not natural language processing that would be hard to scale but to understand the environmental context of where you are to improve the contextual value of the ad itself is possible facebook has long denied allegations that 's at listen non - users in order to customize ads i run ads product at facebook we do not and have never used your microphone for ads just not true robin goldman vice president of ads product at facebook tweeted on october 2017 that includes facebook owned instagram he added one thing you need to consider when you hear a pr statement from anybody is that people generally do not volunteer information that they do not have to take for instance the latest data scandal facebook says that you can download your data and see exactly what they have on you and in many of the instances you can actually request that they delete it what they do not tell you is that they have collected information about you from other people and you have no access to that and you can not delete it",0.357,this allows travel among all eu member states american officials always proclaim they are following the science but obviously if the science gave clear orders then european scientists would have received them too let us say for the purpose of argument that you accept natural immunity as equally good or better than vaccine immunity what are the ethical consequences vaccinating people who 've had covet without informing them that the data says they do not need it overrides both informed consent and the classical medical ethic of not treating without a medical necessity when one gives any intervention that is not medically necessary or especially beneficial then the cost - benefit analysis of risk versus little or no benefit is weighted in favor of risk which overrides the first principle of hippocratic medicine first do no harm it 's also arguably selfish to vaccinate those in wealthy countries who already have natural immunity for it deprives poor countries short of vaccines of protection for their vulnerable populations it 's not lost on the vaccine hesitant that vaccine exemptions for those who already had covet would immediately slash the projected profits of big pharma pharma knows that poor countries might not be able to afford the leftovers at full fee vaccination is a tool a means to an end immunity but the american government has made the means vaccination the new end this strange substitution or reversal reveals the master narrative to be the expression not of science but of a new kind of scientific ideology which we might call vaccineism but vaccine ism is not a treatment it 's a mindset one that takes a wonderful invention which if used properly and carefully can be outstandingly productive and makes it the only tool worth having until it becomes at times counterproductive it makes no exceptions indeed it 's insulted by the idea of any exemptions in its all - or - nothing approach it is the ideological mirror of anti - vaxxism 4 getting out science has had many surprises for us in this pandemic we have learned that while the vaccines do not always stop the spread they do protect the vaccinated from getting severe disease and death for a number of months we have learned as the new york times points out that quote an unvaccinated child is less at risk of serious covet illness than a vaccinated 70 year old close quote though we learned that emily oster the author and academic who first called that fact to our attention was mistreated for months because she was off narrative we have also learned that you are safer in a room or even on a plane with people who have recovered from covid than you are with people who are vaccinated especially over four months ago in other words the immunity of those who suffered covet is holding up so far so why does not good news like this sink in i submit it 's because of our old friend the behavioral immune system many people 's mental set for the pandemic was formed early on when the behavioral immune system was on fire and they were schooled by a master narrative that promised there would be only one type of person who would not pose a danger the vaccinated person stuck in that mindset when confronted by unvaccinated people about half of whom are immune they respond with bis - generated fear hostility and loathing some take it further and seem almost addicted to being scared or remain caught in a kind of post - traumatic lockdown nostalgia demanding that all the previous protections go on indefinitely never factoring in the costs and triggering ever more distrust their minds are hijacked by a primal archaic cognitively rigid brain circuit and will not rest until every last person is vaccinated to some it started to seem like this is the mindset not only of a certain cohort of their fellow citizens but of the government itself moreover because coveted vaccine hesitancy is based in significant part on distrust of the government and related institutions it has to be understood not only in terms of vaccines but in the context of the pandemic more broadly first and foremost in other words of the experience of lockdowns for many trust was broken by the lockdowns which devastated small businesses and their employees even when they complied with safety rules such that an estimated one - third of these businesses that were open in january of 2020 were closed in april of 2021 even as we kept open huge corporate box stores where people crowded together these policies were arguably the biggest assault on the working classes many of whom protected the rest of us by keeping society going in the worst of the pandemic in decades that these policies also enrich the already incredibly wealthy the combined wealth of the world 's 10 richest men the likes of jeff bezos mark zuckerberg bill gates and larry page is estimated to have risen by 540 billion dollars in the first 10 months of the pandemic and that various politicians who instituted lockdowns were regularly caught skirting their own regulations solidified this distrust and yet it is the unvaccinated who many leading officials still portray as recklessly endangering the rest of the country quote we are going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated co - workers president biden has said the unvaccinated are now presented as the sole source of future variants prolonging the pain for the rest of us for those in favor of mandates the vaccine is the only way out of the crisis to them the vaccine hesitant are merely ignorant and defy science we try to use a voluntary approach they believe but these people are neanderthal who must now be coerced into treatment or be punished among the punishments called for is not just loss of employment but also of unemployment insurance health care access to icu beds even the ability to go to grocery stores it 's not trivial to override the core felt sense in a democracy that if anything is one 's own it 's one 's body the idea of the state or a doctor performing a medical procedure forcibly on a person or drugging them into compliance without their consent is an abiding terrifying theme of many science fiction dystopias and it 's a fear that runs very deep in the modern psyche this fear runs deeper in some people than their fear of the virus or losing their jobs or pensions as we are seeing history shows that these are not just fantasies past medical and public health abuses really did make use of forced injections of drugs operations sterilizations and even psychiatric abuses in totalitarian and democratic societies both moreover to say to the unvaccinated but it 's in the name of the greater good is to make the utilitarian argument that we must strive for the most good for the greatest number of people a version of utilitarianism is often the governing philosophy of public health but this raises a series of questions how are we measuring the good is it the same for all people should it be up to your 89 year old grandmother who has little time left to decide whether to spend the remaining years of her life in total isolation or risk hovid but see her loved ones and the bigger questions can you explain how you are helping the group when by overriding individual rights you degrade the group as a whole by weakening each individual within it are you aware that the greatest evils in history have also always been done in the name of that abstraction the greater good without first answering such questions utilitarianism is but a shallow form of arithmetic one passing itself off as moral philosophy it is not irrational for people to insist that public discourse seriously engage questions like these and that any state compulsion related to people 's bodies be based on a flawless airtight argument that is well communicated that has not happened what in rational political and public health terms is the state 's best justification for mandating that people be injected on mass with the medicine the first justification for mandates is that they get us to hurt immunity faster but as stanford epidemiologist jay batacharya and arizona state university economist jonathan ketchum note quote we have good reason to doubt that if most everyone got vaccinated we 'd achieve herd immunity close quote this is because as we have seen current vaccines are fading at about five months even scientists who believe vaccines will help get us to herd immunity are divided on what percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated to get us there early in the pandemic fauci said we needed as low as 60 to 70 percent to reach herd immunity but as time went on he increased the numbers in december 2020 when the new york times noticed fauci was quote quietly shifting the number upward close quote he explained he was generating these percentages based on a mix of the science and what he felt the public was ready to hear admitting quote we really do not know what the real number is close quote president biden recently said we could need 98 percent of americans to be vaccinated to reach the goal is there a scientific consensus behind the 98 claim in fact a number of epidemiologists and infectious disease experts and officials dispute that we need a number anywhere near it even those who are pro - mandate like dr monica gandhi professor of clinical medicine at the university of california san francisco believes that quote there is no evidence that we need that high of a vaccination rate 98 percent to get back to normal close quote other countries like denmark have opted for a 74 vaccination rate as acceptable in order to lift certain restrictions especially if the most vulnerable are vaccinated at a higher rate norway lifted all restrictions when it got to a 67 vaccination rate the point here is that the science is shifting sometimes by the day it is reasonable for people who notice this to feel concerned about it and it is at the very least churlish to present them as merely irrational the second justification for mandates is that the state has an obligation to protect those who can not protect themselves from an infectious disease passed on to them by others i.e the unvaccinated do not have a right to quote recklessly endanger close quote and infect others but as many have pointed out it is hard to describe our current moment quite this way since vaccines and now boosters are freely and widely available so people can protect themselves if they wish of course this reveals the real problem which is that vaccinated people do not in fact get comprehensive immunity as in the case for example of the polio or measles vaccines and on this there is increasing scientific agreement we can not eradicate this mutating virus at this point it is likely not a case like smallpox which was eradicated because both the virus and the vaccines met a host of criteria donald ainsley henderson who directed the who smallpox eradication campaign wrote that smallpox was uniquely suited for eradication because it do not exist in animal reservoirs it was easy to identify cases in even the smallest villages by its distinctive awful rash so a test for it was not needed the vaccine gave immunity that lasted a decade and natural immunity was easy to identify by the scars smallpox left covet satisfies none of these conditions quote if we are forced to choose a vaccine that gives only one year of protection close quote said larry brilliant an epidemiologist also involved in smallpox elimination quote then we are doomed to have coveted become endemic an infection that is always with us close quote he and five other scientists have since argued together that covet is not going away because it 's growing in a dozen animal species and variants allow it to pop up in places that once beat it back indeed this is the reason that some scientists argue we need over 90 of people vaccinated to keep america safe from a virus that will ping - pong around the unvaccinated parts of the globe for years as brilliant and colleagues wrote recently quote among humans global herd immunity once promoted as a singular solution is unreachable close,0.9912,i am jazz and it feels good to be yourself which says quote some people are boys some people are girls some people are both neither or somewhere in between in an emailed appearance the district 's director of equity advancement dr regina haskins explains that the schools have quote redoubled district - wide efforts to attend to the social and emotional needs of children and adults it explains that the aforementioned social justice standards come from the framework of the collaborative for academic social and emotional learning haskins writes that the group acknowledges that while sel alone will not solve long - standing and deep - seated inequities in the education system it can help schools promote understanding examine biases reflect on and address the impact of racism close opportunity gaps and create a more inclusive school community so we are now indoctrinating kindergartners in connecticut in the idea that boys and girls are malleable categories and that a boy can be a girl and a girl can be a boy because there is nothing that is healthier for a child than confusing them about their gender let me just explain something about children i have three there are seven five and one if anybody approached my kids and started telling them about how they might be a member of the opposite sex that person would be out of my house so fast would make your head swim this is predatory behavior upon children confusing children about their sex is disgusting it 's disgusting gender dysphoria is an actual condition it is not a cute little thing that ought to be promulgated to tens of millions of school children across the united states gender dysphoria is an actual mental disorder according to the dsm-5 pretending that mental disorder is is a somehow referendum on the notion that there are binary sexes in life or that your child should be taught about the supposed malleability of sex contra all science and evidence is a way for you to prey on children it 's a way for you to screw up kids who are not suffering from gender dysphoria the belief that in service to kids who have gender dysphoria you have to screw up an entire generation of children by telling them that inborn biological characteristics are of no consequence whatsoever is it 's vile and parents should be standing up to it at every single level it is not merely connecticut public schools that are now teaching this sort of crap according to the new york post a new hampshire teenager is suing his school district after he was allegedly suspended from athletics for saying there are only two genders the exeter high school freshman said in the suit he was hit with a one game football suspension in september stemming from a text conversation he had with another student off school grounds the lawsuit was filed november 4 through an attorney with a christian organization cornerstone action with the claim that he stated a catholic - based belief that there are only male and female genders by the way that 's not a catholic - based belief that 's reality okay because either gender is a complete spectrum in which there are an infinite number of genders or there is a male gender and a female gender and you can sometimes have characteristics of one or the other while being a biological male so it can be an effeminate male or you can be a very masculine female but that does not change the fact that male and female are categories that exist the kids lawsuit also claims exeter 's policy on non - binary gender identity and pronouns infringes on his first amendment rights the policy says students have a right to be addressed a right to be addressed by a name and pronoun of their choosing related to their gender identities and also says those who do not recognize others gender identities or pronouns are violating the policy the student was suspended for denying that people can belong to a gender other than that of male or female the student it goes on will never refer to any individual person using plural pronouns such as they using contrived pronouns such as g or with any similar terminology that reflects values the student does not share the suspension came after the student had been engaged in a conversation on the bus over gender with friends over the perceived difficulty in using plural pronouns for an individual in spanish which uses masculine and feminine plurals a female student overheard the discussion allegedly told the student there were more than two genders no there are not there 's only two genders the student allegedly replied that conversation continued in contentious text exchange which was shown to him by school administrators in printed form when he was suspended so students now being suspended for the great crime of pointing out the reality which is that male and female are categories that exist meanwhile in florida according to breitbart.com parents of a 13 year old daughter have filed a federal lawsuit against a florida school district after officials at deer lake middle school secretly transitioned her into a transgender male or a biological girl who says she wants to live as a boy including her including allowing her to use male spaces like bathrooms and choosing pronouns and this of course is the scariest and most insane thing that is happening at our nation 's public schools not just happening in the public schools by the way it 's happening in the medical context as well abigail schreier reported on this case in washington state where there was a kid who was suicidal happened to be autistic was put on 72 - hour suicide watch and in the process of that suicide watch the administrators at this facility convinced the kid basically that he was a member of the opposite gender and then told the parents that unless they started transition processes the kid would not be released back to them the parents took the kid moved out of state the kid is still living as his biological sex happily not in the state of washington,0.7608,this is why it 's important to know when you are being manipulated when someone switching between stats that include gang violence and terrorism until they do not because yes the united states certainly has more gang on gang crime europe has a startling trend of more predator against defenseless victim crime a big factor for that we will address later on in this video that she never mentions it 's not that america has much more crime it 's that crime in the us is much more lethal altogether the number of gun deaths in the us from 2000 to 2013 exceeds the number of americans killed by aids by illegal drug overdoses the iraq and afghanistan wars and terrorism combined it should be clear by now that this level of gun violence is a uniquely american problem among the developed world first off why does she throw aids in there aids is not a serious problem for most americans unless involved in shall we say very specific activities why would would you include drugs on that list but not the fact that 80 % of gun homicides are drug related also how are war casualties not gun related is this only mortar fire is it water boarding outliers what i am also imagining this would be skewed uh considering that san bernardino would be included down here and not up here with terrorism it should be clear by now that this level of gun violence is a uniquely american problem among the developed world this is important here because she finishes on the words gun violence but this big scary black bar is not indicative of gun violence it 's total firearm related deaths that 's important because when comparing actual gun homicide rates worldwide the united states only ranks 28th this is a pivotal slight of hand here because this includes total firearm deaths right before she pivots this level of gun violence is a uniquely american problem among the developed world and here 's one reason why there are a ton of guns in the us this chart shows the estimated number of guns by country it 's adjusted for population size and it 's still not even close ah see now this chart is comparing countries but this chart is not about homicide it 's not about firearm deaths it 's only about gun ownership all of this is designed to lead you into believing that gun ownership legal gun ownership results in increased violent gun crime important to note if gun ownership as seen in this chart is so much higher but the united states still ranks 28th in gun related deaths why is that the case it also ironically unravels her own point if gun ownership is so drastically higher in the united states but we are only 28th ranked in overall gun homicide rate that means proportionally legal gun owners in the united states are committing fewer crimes if you take a look back at the 10 countries with the highest levels of human development you can see that it 's relatively really easy to get a gun in the us all of the other countries require a license to purchase most guns and those purchases are recorded into an official reg industry to get that license people have to state a reason for why they want a gun and in most of these countries they have to pass the safety test and are required by law to store their guns safely first off it 's funny how they put right to bear arms siging out the united states as a negative here in this chart which is tipping their hand because that 's ultimately their end goal but they will tell you you are crazy you are paranoid if you think that leftists just want to take your guns away brief history lesson the united states has a second amendment because of a very different history than these other countries unlike canada for example who bent over for the king the united states decided to fight for freedom and we wanted to hang on to that right to ensure that we were never taken over by a tyrant like i do not know say hitler something else to note along with the 80 % drug rated gun homicide is most gun crime occurs in heavily populated areas urban areas big cities and the united states has more big cities than many countries on this list combined which is why many crime bureaus readily admit that comparing violent crimes across different countries is nearly impossible to do in part because of its lack laws there are well over 300 million guns in the us and counting this chart does not reflect private sales but it shows the number of background checks which all federally licensed dealers have to run it suggests that the demand for guns has been increasing steeply since barack obama took office this part is absolutely true despite how hard it is to trust someone who can not properly spell obama i know with barack obama 's demagoguery people were concerned and many did exercise their second amendment right for the very first time,0.9622
but then we got rid of jim crow and then we had segregation laws and we kept black people out of certain neighborhoods then we got rid of those laws then we elected a black president in 2008 see i have got all these data points and i can see the trend the races are coming together in the united states they 'd say ok now plenty of students could be told as they are in public schools all around the country that race relations have not really improved it 's all a lie things are just as bad today as they were a hundred years ago and if you do not have all of those facts you might have the broad trend but you would not know if that 's true you 'd be ignorant and you would not even know to look it up you would not even know to google it because you you do not know what you do not know donald rumsfeld when he was secretary of defense ten years ago he said there are known knowns known unknowns and unknown unknowns so there are things that you know that you know that you know then there are things that you know that you do not know for instance i do not know much about the reign of charlemagne i know that charlemagne existed i know he was an historical figure i just do not actually know the specifics and then there are certain things that you do not know that you do not know increasingly that category is expanding and so i think that 's a big part in why we are all getting stupider there are other theories as well a bunch of left wingers are blaming it on global warming they are saying that because of global warming somehow food is getting less nutritious and it 's killing our brains and you know the smog and the sun monster and i of course there 's no evidence for any of this really we we do not know for certain we have a couple hunches and but the effect does seem to be real i really like this story for a couple reasons one because it does cut against the premise of progressivism what conservatives like to point out is that history does not go in a straight line sometimes things get better sometimes things get worse sometimes things get better in one place but worse in another place history is kind of like a big zigzag and the individual actions of men and communities and nations really matter and what the progressives want to say is old time bad modern time good old people stupid modern people smart that 's what they like to tell us so this is why we scoff at our own history why we want to rename the thomas jefferson dinners because we say oh that is a bad old guy he owns slaves he 's bad we were good because we are modern we live in the in the modern age which is much better so this obviously cuts against that we are not smarter than our forebears at least our forebears 20 years ago they had a higher average intelligence than we do the other reason i like this story is i do not put a whole lot of stock in iq,0.1629,but it just goes to show you the tenterhooks that democrats are on democrats are so concerned everybody is so concerned and here 's the thing i do not think that that 's true i do not even think that the democrats are all that concerned about this stuff i really do not think the democrats think that the missiles are fly and that we are this far away from nuclear war i think they are just trying to promote a notion that we are very close to some sort of destabilizing event even though things are relatively stable and here 's the thing the american people are not buying this the american people are not buying this in any real way and the way you can tell this is you can look at the presidents poll approval number so according to a brand - new rasmussen poll president trump 's approval numbers have now climbed back to 46 % which is near the highest of his presidency all the other polls have reflected that bump as well the nbc wall street journal poll over the weekend showed trump at an all - time high of 45 percent now it is important to note that 45 % is not 50 % but it is also important to note that the presidents of the united states won his election when his approval rating was about 40 to 43 percent so you do not have to have really high approval ratings in order to win a presidential election and all of this despite the fact that president trump 's moves with vladimir putin last week in the helsinki conference were not wildly popular with anybody except for republicans the poll showed 53 % of republicans approved of trump 's behavior at his meeting with russian dictator vladimir putin which is not a good number among republicans only six percent of democrats did but none of that mattered much to the overall approval for president trump the overall approval among republicans for president trump currently stands at 88 percent that is the highest intra - party approval ever polled ever polled so among republicans no president has ever been more popular than president trump is right now and that has something to do with president truman has a lot more to do with president trump 's opponents as we will talk about in a little while so what exactly is bolstering trump 's high approval rating or at least decent approval rating right now well the nbc wall street journal poll suggests that trump is very very reliant on the economy so 50 percent of americans like the way he is handling the economy as opposed to only 36 percent of americans who do not so all the democratic talk about how the economy is going to collapse because of the tax cuts around the verge of an economic breakdown most americans do not believe that they believe the economy is strong and president trump is feeling the effects of that 51 percent of americans disliked the way that trump has handled putin overall 58 percent disapprove of his immigration policy 53 percent approve of his tariff policy what this adds up to is about 45 % of americans overall approve of president trump which for president trump is a very good number 45 46 % and here 's the thing those poll numbers have really not budged much for the president of the united states in the last two - and - a - half years trump 's approval rating has been remarkably stable since long before he was president of the united states he began his presidency at about 44 % he is now at 45 % after a year and a half not a lot of volatility in those polls news coverage simply does not touch trump it does not touch him because pretty much everything is baked in when people have an image of particular people and they jump to that image whenever they are in town so republicans have an image of president trump as a fighter who 's willing to take on the media and who 's being wrongly maligned by a bunch of people on the left and so whenever anything bad happens to trump they jump right into that framework and democrats have a framework of trump where everything he 's doing is simultaneously buffoonish and evil it 's manipulative and clownish those are the two things that trump is according to the left and so anything that trump does has to fall into one of those two categories but the bottom line is that trump is basically the super bowl of public opinion everybody has an opinion about the super bowl everybody watches the super bowl everybody watches the commercial you are president trump is the center of the universe of the political universe right now he 's the thing everybody is watching and everybody is talking about and so that means that everyone already has an opinion on him i mean they are no undecideds when it comes to president trump you can not find one seriously can you name anyone in your own personal life who does not have an opinion about president trump of course not and that means that his approval ratings are going to be relatively stable now is that good for republicans are bad for republicans well it 's good for presidential elections it 's good for presidential elections because it means that the presidential election will not actually be a referendum on president trump it will be a referendum on the income it will be in a referendum on who the democrats pick and this was for in 2016 if you look at 2016 the media got it completely wrong about who the referendum was about now i got the election result wrong just like every other pollster but what i did get right as i said this was not going to be a referendum on president trump it was going to be a referendum on hillary clinton because trump was very stable but hillary was bouncing around all over the place the truth is that trump his election his election urine played a lot more like an incumbent incumbent president 's usually win and the reason they usually win when i say usually i mean that only one president has ever been defeated after one term without a serious third party challenger since 1932,0.5163,under the guise of various fancy sounding terms like diversity equity and inclusion dei racial bias training and sensitivity and inclusion seminars for years now major corporations have been forcing their employees and especially new hires to undergo various classes derived from critical race theory to indoctrinate them about how terrible white people are and how amazing non - whites and lgbtq people are the anti - racism grifters who in reality are just anti - white racist have been around for a long time but it became commonplace for major corporations to hire them to teach employees about how white people perpetuate racism simply by existing if they do not constantly prioritize black people 's thoughts and feelings and give them promotions just for being black white employees are put through training where they are told that the united states is a white supremacist system and if they are white and they do not think that they are racist and part of the problem that 's just more evidence of their internalized racial superiority many companies added entire sections on their websites explaining their plans on how they are hiring more people of color in the name of diversity equity and inclusion despite favoring any particular race in the hiring process being illegal leaked documents show that at&t 's diversity equity and inclusion training course labels white employees the problem and says that american racism is a uniquely white trait and black people can not be racist they also encourage them to take the 21 - day racial equity habit challenge to reflect on their white privilege and be on the lookout for white supremacy which just means not prioritizing black and brown people many major corporations now have an entire department dedicated to diversity equity and inclusion as we all know now and have titles like head of diversity and it 's their entire job to make sure that fewer white people and heteros uals are hired to work there linkedin in the employment and business focused social media platform started enabling job recruiters to filter their searches for candidates according to race in order to help them find a more diverse group of candidates it used to be an unwritten rule that job applicants not include their race on their resumés to help avoid racial bias during the hiring process but now it 's encouraged for non - white people to list theirs so they can be picked as a diversity hire when the hiring manager of dropbox the google owned cloud storage service posted about a new position open for product design in the us she said that applicants from byo black indigenous and people of color and ir communities underrepresented minority communities meaning lgbtq people were given priority over all others of course that 's a violation of the federal law because a business can not pass up job applicants simply because of their race but as usual systemic anti - white ism has been ignored if a hiring manager of any business business whether a fortune 500 company or a small family - owned pizzeria posted that they were prioritizing white applicants then the department of labor would launch an investigation into them immediately and sue them into bankruptcy but for years no action was taken when white people or christians were blatantly discriminated against youtube actually got sued in 2018 because of their anti - white hiring policy a recruiter worked for them for 9 years revealed that the company set quotas for hiring non - white people and recruit were told not even to interview applicants who were not black hispanic or women on valentine 's day that same year the official youtube twitter account tweeted roses are red violets are blue subscribe to black creators youtube as a company has also been hostile towards thanksgiving they posted an animated gift on twitter uh one year showing a group of native american girls tipping over a dinner table filled with traditional food and protest of the holiday they also posted a link to video by franchesca ramsey best enough for complaining about white kids wearing certain halloween costumes remember her titled five comebacks for your racist relative during the holidays because leftists obsess over nonwhite people who suffer from inferiority complexes previous years 's tweets have been about helping nonprofit organizations feed homeless people and the needy on thanksgiving or thanksgiving fun facts but that was before youtube went full libtard the company also host an annual event exclusively for black youtubers to give them extra help to build up their subscribers comedian tyler fischer was turned down by a hollywood agent because he 's white so he 's sued for discrimination and the talent agency quickly offered him a settlement which he refused saying he wanted the case to go to court most likely because a settlement would mean that he would have to sign a non - disclosure agreement preventing him from ever talking about what happened to him again responding to a headline in the new york post that said he claimed the agent turned him down because he 's white fischer said that the entire conversation is on tape because he recorded it and said that he 's not going to stand by and allow people to discriminate against him because he 's white adding there 's no such thing as reverse discrimination there 's one kind and everyone is protected under the law against it he also said that tons of people in the industry had reached out to him privately telling him the same thing happened to them but they were afraid to speak about it publicly it 's not just major corporations hollywood talent agencies and big tech social media platforms but many cities are also indoctrinating their employees with anti - his in recent years such training programs became mandated across the country for elected officials and their staff many police departments and fire departments started requiring such indoctrination as well these race and social justice initiatives teach the same nonsense that white staffers are responsible for racism and our oppressors of non - whites a teachers union in minneapolis announced that they plan to lay off white teachers first if they have to make budget cuts regardless of seniority explaining in orwellian language if excessing meaning laying off a teacher who is a member of a population underrepresented among licensed teachers in the site the school the district shall access the next least senior teacher who is not a member of an underrepresented population they always try to mask their agenda by using code words excess means to lay off and underrepresented means if they are not white they will be passed over and the white teachers will be laid off instead again all of this is illegal and violates long - standing anti - discrimination laws and the fact that such blatant racial discrimination would be adopted by so many organizations is shocking but perhaps even more disturbing is the lack of legal consequences for their actions the department of labor and the justice department under the bid administration just do not enforce anti - discrimination laws when the discrimination was against white people but things they are a changing which i will get into in a moment subscribe to my channel if you are new here by the way because you are not going to get unvarnished content and analysis like this anywhere else uber 's head of diversity in asian woman was suspended after she held an event where she tried to encourage employees black employees to stop calling their white co - workers karens which has become an anti - white slur that black people like to use against white women who they view as being entitled or bossy because of their white privilege and some people think that it 's not a racial slur because everybody thinks that anybody can be a karen but black people use it as a racial slur but the black employees at uber felt like they were being lectured and scolded so they accused the executive of being racist against them many black people feel so entitled these days in america that when a company executive tries nicely to get them to stop being racist against white people they view that as racist james o'keefe 's undercover investigation into disney revealed that the upper management are all explicitly told that the company discriminates against white males under the guise of diversity in the hiring process and when considering promotions james o'keefe also obtained video of ibm 's ceo openly threatening not to pay managers bonuses if they do not discriminate against white people and he was not even caught on a hidden camera like the disney executive was admitting how they talk about their policies behind closed doors the ibm ceo said it on a company conference call that 's how bold and pervasive anti - white ism has become in major corporations they do not even think about the repercussions for their discrimination because it 's been taboo for so long for a white person to dare to point out that racism is not just something that white people do to non - whites it 's something that people of every race engage in against others outside of their group especially because a lot of people have a lot of jealousy towards white people people let us be honest after the black lives matter insurrection of 2020 under the banner of patron st george floyd anti - white ism became the norm in america and instead of equality the leftist pulled a bait and switch and started talking about equity shifting the conversation away from racial equality which we had achieved in this country many decades ago to equity meaning non - whites were now supposed to get special treatment and extra rights and protections and more perks and benefits and favors than white people to supposedly make up for poor treatment other ethnic groups got in the distant past democrat 's favorite tactic of calling white people racist has grown into an entire industry filled with high- paid experts who get paid to just complain about white people all day every day people like robin d'angelo who was credited with popularizing the term white fragility which is used as a weapon against white people and was constructed to depict white people who are tired of hearing black people complain about them as being a character flaw and more evidence that they are racist because they do not want to acknowledge or address their own white privilege ibram x kendi which is a fake name to try to make himself sound cool like malcolm x is another popular race grifter his real name is ibram henry rogers by the way and he works as an anti - racist activist meaning an anti - white activist in his mind white people are the cause of all racism in the world and like all other race hustlers he ignores racial conflicts between blacks and latinos which are common in places like los angeles especially between rival gangs the only thing ibram x kendi thinks about is how terrible white people are the 1619 project founder nicole hannah jones is another one this project started off as a feature in the new york times and refers to the year 1619 when she claims black slaves started building america for white people al sharpton got his start as a race hustler back in the 1980s with the toana,0.2904,hey that is something that we that by the way that was true for most of american history and only became public sector unions as important facets of american life in the 1930s really on late 1930s under fdr and under the wagner act but those are things left will not agree on in a moment because as soon as we get down to specifics we realize the left does not actually care about the specifics for a lot of people politically all they care about is the broader message which we will get to so in the last 96 hours here 's what 's happened to the police officers who broadly speaking have been maligned as racist and part of a systemically discriminatory system a las vegas metropolitan police officer shot in the back of the head struggling with a rioter an active shooter opened fire on law enforcement at a las vegas courthouse for st . louis police officers were shot by an active shooter a new york police officer was struck by a vehicle three buffalo law enforcement

thanks to this debate nate silver points out that his numbers are going the wrong direction that there has been a a somewhat small but also somewhat durable increase in the polling numbers for donald trump that since the debate donald trump has jumped about two percentage points in the polling data the latest poll survey usa has trump up two the new york times sienna poll that was taken before the debate has trump up four there 's a poll that just came out after the debate and it shows trump up five that is from atlant atlas intel that 's trump plus 5.2 at 45.5 to 40.3 with rfk picking up 10 % full scale disaster area here for the biden campaign so again there 's been a wide divide on the left between whether biden should stay or whether he should go and the only question is how close you are to joe biden personally that really is what it is if you are a member of the media you are basically calling for him to go if you are a member of the democratic political establishment you are calling for him to stay why if you are remember because now their interests actually diverge so since 2008 when barack obama was elected president democrats and the media have basically been one giant blob they are the same they are indistinguishable which is why you can have a revolving door of jens saki from the white house to m msnbc and then maybe back to the white house and then back to msnbc this is how it works it 's the same the press has just been an apparatus of the democratic white houses that 's all the democratic party the press indistinguishable but that all changed last week why because the credibility of the press was invested in joe biden not being the thing they all said that he was not and then he was the thing so now the press have their own interests in upholding their own veracity for having written article after article after article saying that all stories about his cility were republicans pound stories so the new york times editorial board literally called for joe biden not to run again quote president biden has repeatedly and rightfully described the stakes in this november 's presidential election as nothing less than the future of american democracy biden has said he is the candidate with the best chance of taking on this threat of tyranny and defeating it his argument rests largely on the fact that he beat trump in 2020 that is no longer a sufficient rationale for why mr biden should be the democratic nominee this year at thursday 's the president needed to convince the american public he was equal to the formidable demands of the office he is seeking to hold for another term voters however can not be expected to ignore what was instead pl to see mr biden is not the man he was four years ago as it stands the president is engaged in a reckless gamble their are democratic leaders better equipped to present clear compelling energetic alternatives to a second trump presidency there 's no reason for the party to risk the stability and security of the country by forcing voters to choose between trump 's deficiencies and those of biden it 's too big a bet to simply hope americans will overlook or discount mr biden 's age and infirmity that they see with their very own eyes if the race comes down to a choice between trump and biden the sitting president would be this board 's unequivocal pick but that 's how much of a danger trump poses given that very danger the stakes for the country and the uneven abil abilities of mr biden the united states needs a stronger opponent to the presumptive republican nominee so that is the new york times editorial board calling for joe biden to step out of the race now here is the thing if joe biden is not capable of running the race he should not be president they should 25th amendment that guy if he is too scile to run he is too scile to be president of the united states axio reports he is not sentient between the hours of 400 p.m. and 10 : a.m. all the way around the clock he 's sentient for most of the hours my kids are in school that that is legitimately what axos is now reporting so the media are saying the truth bizarrely because again they require the credibility of saying the truth late after lying to all of us here 's jonathan carl of abc news saying very few democrats are pretending joe biden did well the other day even before the debate there was a sense of dread among many democrats a fear that the campaign was heading toward something they consider unthinkable a donald trump victory in november president biden needed a strong debate to show that he has the physical and mental ability to take on and defeat donald trump that 's why he spent nearly a week at camp david with an army of of advisors preparing for a debate with rules and a format that his advisers designed few prominent democrats are even pretending he did what he needed to do on that debate stage by the way democrats are now worried that joe biden is going to drag down all the senate candidates so one of the oddities is that democratic candidates are outpolling biden in nearly every swing state this year so shered brown in ohio he 's outpolling biden in pennsylvania bob casey is outpolling biden in pennsylvania in arizona the democratic candidate for senate ruben gyo outp polling biden so biden is actually trailing every senate candidate for the democrats but the problem is that if turnouts real low for the democrats they lose all those seats so they are freaking out the wall street journal reports quote democrats who worried about president biden 's reelect prospects even before his uneven debate thursday had been pointing to a bright spot in this year 's campaign the party senate candidates and some vulnerable house candidates generally pull better than the weekend president now those democratic candidates and their aids are trying to sort through whether biden 's halting performance and sometimes dazed appearance have sapped the party 's goals of retaining the senate and flipping the house both chambers with thin majorities are in play this fall by the way report from political this morning the democrats in the house are now basically begging their donors they need the house because they are not going to win the presidency again members of the press who are probably going to vote for joe biden no matter what even they are appalled by what they saw or at least pretending to be so i will give it to listen bill maher i am friendly with bill has been honest about this since the beginning that biden is diminished and that he expected trump to run strong but here is mah listen to the audience it 's less about what mah is saying and more about the audience the entire mah audience which is a leftwing audience i know i have been on the show many times the entire audience is laughing at joe biden 's performance because everyone sees the thing here 's mah you know joe he famously loves trains but apparently not of thought just all night confused and halting and trailing off i have seen beauty patching contestants answer questions better i do not want to say the bad there 's no secret service name is amber herd i am coming on even the folks over at pod safe america were were very upset about all of this so the pod bros and postive those are all obama boys so the obama team they have always seen joe as a very fragile vessel for the obama agenda and now they are like god bless it we are we are going to throw this guy under the bus here 's medy hassan qatari frontman and uh and the boys at pods save america lamenting the fall of joe biden here i have been to georgia i have been to michigan recently every single brown person i met people who voted democrat all their lives say we are not voting democratic we want to punish biden now do not shoot the messenger i am just telling you that is what people are saying i dare you to ask all those people to vote again this morning after what they watched last night it 's just not the same thing we are we are in a very different place people saw the car crash in front of their eyes i understand that the biggest challenge in this race has been to capture people 's attention in a very fractured media environment there are now no more opportunities because there one opportunity when 50 million americans tuned in joe biden did not show up the party does not have a problem with democrats it has a problem with joe biden that 's what people are trying to tell us right now,0.8229,"just a quick reminder the best deal of the year is now here 50 % off your new dailywire plus annual memberships go to dailywire.com subscribe right now to join last night the israeli war cabinet approved a hostage deal with the terrorist group kamas according to the israeli government the deal will see 50 israeli citizens released mostly women and children in batches of 12 or 13 per day the prime minister 's office has released a full list and that list shows many many young people but their parents still in captivity or dad still in captivity and mom released families destroyed families split and all the rest for each day of such releases israel will pause its current offensive against hamas in the gaza strip israel said it would pause its air operations for 6 hours daily in the northern part of the gaza strip that provision was apparently sought directly by yaya senoir the head of kamas who wants israeli uavs down for that time period to limit israeli surveillance presumably to save his own skin as he tries to escape whatever rat hole he is currently trapped in for its part israel insist it will still have surveillance capacity without the uav kamas will also supposedly allow the international red cross access to the hostages despite the irc 's publicly obvious disinterest in such a mission israel will also release some 150 palestinian terrorists who are women and minors in other words a democratic government is trading terrorists for innocent women and children being held by a terrorist group israel will also allow additional fuel into gaza presumably to be stolen by hamas the deal is supported by the israeli defense forces the shinb and mad that support led many of the members of the war cabinet to flip from opposing the deal to supporting it according to the times of israel prime minister benjamin netanyahu further insisted on the potential release of more hostages a refusal to release terrorists convicted of murder and a commitment by hamas to locate the other hostages held by other terror groups in the gaza strip that last point is really important there are multiple distinct groups in the gaza strip reportedly holding israeli 's hostage and some of those groups are actually gazan civilians who participated in the massacre of october 7th according to the times of israel quoting an unnamed government official quote israel believes hamas could potentially locate some 30 more israeli mothers and children beyond the initial 50 and that the halt and fighting could be extended by a day for each group of 10 more israeli hostages who are located and freed the israeli government released a statement adding quote the israeli government the idf and security forces will continue the war to return all the abductees complete the elimination of hamas and ensure that gaza does not renew any threat to the state of israel here was prime minister netanyahu explaining that after this pause the war to eviscerate hamas will continue he says outside there 's a lot of nonsense talk as if after we cease fire for the release of the hostages will stop the [ music ] war so i would like to clarify we are at war and we will continue to fight until we reach all our goals says in more than our stage and also in the returning of hostages there stages we will not let go until we reach the absolute victory and until we bring them all back this deal is in fact highly controversial inside of israel there are two separate strains of logic being applied on the one side there are those who believe that as the court en tiens around hamas they will start killing hostages that israel must do what it can right now to free as many hostages as possible before that happens they believe that israel will be able to continue to successfully pursue its long - term goal of eradicating kamas even if that goal is made more difficult by hamas 's activities during the pause in fighting there is some evidence to support this idea yesterday for example palestinian islamic jihad released news of the death of one of the hostages which they then promptly blamed on israel procrastinating which is weird because the hostages would not even be in gaza if terrorist groups had not taken them there bring the hostages home as fast as possible at the lowest possible cost and then destroy hamas that is the logic of those who support the deal on the other side side there are those who worry that hostage deals have always been terrible policy they remember the 2011 gilad shalit deal in which israel obtained the release of one kidnapped israeli soldier from kamas in return for and i am not reading the statistic wrong 1,27 prisoners including 280 serving life sentences for planning and perpetrating terrorism those prisoners were at the time responsible for nearly 600 israeli deaths in fact one of the prisoners who was in fact released in that deal was yaya senoir the current leader of kamas who planned october 7th opponents of the deal remember when the authorities told them security in gaza was good enough to withstand the risk those authorities were obviously wrong opponents of the deal worry most of all that the current pause will be used as an excuse by the global community to pressure israel for further quote unquote deescalation with a terrorist group that just slaughtered 12200 israelis and kidnapped another 240 and pledges to do the same and pledged israel 's destruction they worried that as the focus shifts from hamas 's evil to hostage deals there will be a broader effort to leave hamas in place such worries are well founded for its part hamas is already claiming to have achieved such an end last night ishia the political head of kamas living at five - star hotels in qatar released a statement saying a truce was going to happen the term for truce that k used is the same as the term for ceasefire k hopes this will serve as a propaganda victory telling the radical muslim moral that hamas has somehow fought israel to a standstill many in the media are doing the same all the media are using the pause set to go into effect on thursday as an excuse to talk about leaving hamas in place politico today has an article from one colin clark of the sufan group and michael kenny of the university of pittsburgh stating that kamas is actually a kind of nice terrorist group that they are not isis they have merely territorial goals they can be negotiated with according to clark and kenny quote unlike isis some of hamas 's goals are actually political and so there will be no effective solution to the crisis unless it also includes a political resolution that is an absurd contention given the events of october 7th and kamas stated goal of repeating as many october 7th as possible and their stated goal of completely destroying the state of israel but kamas is playing the game kamas released a statement that at the very end suggested that what they are really looking for is an independent palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital never mind that what they mean by that is the complete destruction of the state of israel they are not looking for a two - state solution but that contention that kamas can be left in place is being issued by a wide variety of sources as the pause begins david ignatius of the washington post hopes that the hostage deal will provide a quote surprisingly pragmatic formula for easing the conflict expanding into a deescalation of the nightmare presumably some of the biden administration hope the same that the israelis will simply forget about what kamas wants what kamas has done what hamas pledges to do even before the bodies of october 7th have all been buried the white house is obviously conflicted certain members are standing stalwartly by israel others are fretting over the possibility of iranian aggression in reality if israel leaves hamas in place the possibility of regional conflict grows exponentially it is only the impression of israeli strength that has prevented a wider regional conflict thus far hamas would rearm and declare victory kah would be emboldened in israel 's north terrorist groups in the west bank would grow more violent the houthis in yemen would up the anti the sunni countries would shy away from israel and seek their own methods of defense against the shia incursion creating more opportunities for nuclear proliferation iran would grow more aggressive until they have fully developed a nuclear weapon at which point pretty much all hell would break loose israel must reestablish deterrence and security that is in fact the primary goal hostages are a coincident goal",1.8116,recently we heard that a university canceled the vagina monologs because it was not trans inclusive for those that are not familiar the vagina monologs is a play about women 's issues and this is not the first time it 's happened years ago we saw the same thing the vagina monologs was called not trans inclusive thus it was canceled there are numerous stories that we have seen throughout the years and more so in the past few months where far left ideology is contradicting itself we see socialists who want free health care for all but also believe in open borders which means it 's entirely impossible to implement and there are various other issues showing us that social justice ideology in its attempts to be so inclusive is bringing together groups that are at odds with each other like how we saw the women 's mart get criticized for being homophobic and anti - semitic right now we are actually seeing an editing war over the idea of trans versus women and female on wikipedia so today i want to talk about various instances that show us evidence social justice ideology is unsustainable social justice and the far left are actually and odds with themselves and maybe collapsing but before we get started please head over to patreon comm /team cast to help support my work patrons of the backbone of the content i creighton if you like these videos and want to see more then go to patreon.com/scishow mists and become a patron today from the daily wire vagina monologs canceled at university because not all women have vaginas conservative twitter has some thoughts the school 's women resource center informed students via email that following an evaluation of survey responses about the production the vagina monologs was canceled survey respondents opposing the production consistently indicated they were concerned the play centers on cisgender women that the plays version of feminism excludes some women including trans women and that overall the vagina monolog lacks diversity and inclusion in the first example i want to think about what this means there are certainly people in this world who are born female they face specific issues to being female because they do not want to bring in people or they are not talking about issues faced by other people their event has been shut down it would seem that activists in favor of social justice feminists are being shut down by activists in favor of social justice it 's an inherent contradiction within itself it makes no sense why you would shut down activists for social justice why well because the two groups are at odds with each other and we see this time and time again in various other examples that i will move on to according to the route trans women are women this is not a debate and the reason i am using the route is that according to news whip the route is the most shared left - wing source on facebook the idea that trans women are women is considered fact among ideologues and social constructivists however according to science editors on wikipedia this is not true there 's an extremely interesting contradiction happening in our understanding of the world right now based on wikipedia we can start by looking at the article trans woman it says a trans woman is a woman who was assigned male at birth that is a definitive statement but something strange happens then when you click the word woman it brings you to an article that says a woman is a female human being well that 's completely at odds with what we just read on the other article but something even more interesting happens when you click female according to wikipedia female is the sex of an organism that produces eggs the same exact phenomenon can be seen on trans men they say that a trans man is a man who was assigned female at birth and once again if you go to the man page it says a man is a male human and once again when you go to male it says a male organism produces sperm specific scientific definitions when we look at the talk pages as to why this is happening it actually gets even more interesting for those that are not familiar the talk page of wikipedia is where the article is debated and what to include or exclude is talked about the first section on transmen says it contradicts the articles woman and female it talks about how the intro paragraphs as a trans woman is a type of woman the article in turn says that women are female the article interns define female as the biological definition making wikipedia internally inconsistent the same is true for trans man in the talk page for trans man there 's an extremely similar discussion they offered the possible definition saying a trans man is a woman who wants to be identified by others as a man naturally miriam webster the dictionary also defines woman as an adult female and man as an adult human male either there 's a really good example of the inherent contradictions in social justice and farley ideology the far - left wants to be so inclusive they are willing to include different groups that believe different things even when they are at odds with each other and that 's why we see the vagina monologs get canceled there are people who are born female who say that because females are smaller have less muscle mass have less bone density less collagen there are inherent disadvantages that they have that men do not that means there needs to be special consideration when dealing with certain issues when it comes to the law when it comes to sports the idea that males have an inherent advantage over females is something that is plainly visible to many feminists however this is at odds with the trans community who feels this is not the case and thus they actually come at each other we saw this when a feminist was banned from twitter for saying men are not women feminist megan murphy wrote fork willett twitter 's trans activists decree in talking about how she was banned for hateful conduct according twitter she says the notion that my commentary could be construed as hateful baffled me one tweet read simply men are not women and the other asked how our trans women not men what is the difference between a man and a trans woman the last question is one of asked countless times including in public speeches and i have yet to get a persuasive answer this is what got megan murphy banned from twitter but as i just showed you on wikipedia it clearly defines a man as a human male and male as someone who produces sperm in which case the basic definition is correct what she 's saying is true feminists have long fought for civil rights for women over time the idea of what feminists actually means has become different now people say there 's third wave and fourth wave some people argue that women were never fighting for civil rights,0.4507,the way he has and you are telling me that michigan is supposed to be a toss - up somehow some way he do not even need wisconsin at this moment he do not need wisconsin to be honest all he need to win at this point is nevada georgia north carolina pennsylvania and trump won if he gets nevada he do not even need arizona we are going to talk about arizona if he do not need he do not even need arizona if he wins georgia north carolina pennsylvania nevada trump wins it 's over it 's done your boy can have arizona wisconsin and michigan and trump still wins if you if you want to be honest about the election this should be trump trump trump trump trump trump trump that 's the truth but i think they doing some not not here i mean this is iffy but definitely here they are doing some shady business there now i am going to talk to you guys about what i believe is going on and how i think trump has the path to victory um here soon and let us talk about before we get to that point let us talk about arizona and then i am going to go to my path of of what the what the uh what i believe the campaign thinks that they are going to do and what we have seen that 's going to lead trump to victory now arizona has had a tremendous conflict when it comes to this sharpie thing when i voted and we we are out here in the scottsdale area paradise valley area so where i voted at um i wish i want to give because i want to give away where i live but where i voted at we use pens but i can remember years ago using sharpies so if sharpies do not work i use the sharpie i believe in one of the elections in arizona but what has happened is in republican districts which is what the reports are coming back to me is saying in republican districts where it 's heavily republican they had them um fill out ballots with sharpies now the sharpies bleed through the paper and and when you scan it it 's not going to scan that 's like when you do scantron in school you can not do a scantron with a sharpie because it bleeds through the page they are not going to count the ballots so in republican districts they had people use sharpies which did not count and they got a ton of votes that are still out now let me let me go through the process of explaining to you why the trump administration thinks that they are going to win and why i agree with them uh 200 so right now donald trump as it stands if the legal ballots are counted meaning they can not do stuff where you you got ballots coming in after the polls have closed you got ballots coming in that are not earmarked or not not not time stamped for the election you got random ballots they find in the trash can and doing all the other fraudulent stuff which they are trying to do up here in michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania if we count every legal vote by the constitutional parameters of our voting system things that are not being uh created and made up last minute trump wins hands down he has the votes he wins legal ballots counted he wins thank you baby legal legal ballots counted he win period and people need to understand that they are trying to bet on all of these mail - ins stuff that the flash drives they find and everywhere they are trying to depend on those to win now let us talk about pennsylvania real quick what is the pathway of success for the president in pennsylvania now the administration believes that there 's more than and this is documented proof that there 's more than a million ballots left to be counted including roughly 300 000 in philadelphia um even if you want to be extremely conservative about it completely conservative county they believe that president trump uh receives about five percent of the ballots in philadelphia and 30 percent of the remaining ballots of president trump still win in pennsylvania by 400 or not 440 000 votes so with that scenario trump still wins in pennsylvania um by 400 votes i mean 40 000 votes i am sorry um and the administration is very confident even in the absentee ballots because you have about uh 54 000 ballots left to be counted in cumberland county you have about 40 000 ballots left to be counted in westmoreland county and that 's a county where president trump won 69 of the votes yesterday so there 's still about 40 000 ballots and and if you count the ones yesterday in that county trump won 69 of that then there 's another county in franklin county there 's about 20 000 ballots um that are still remaining and president trump won 82 of those ballots that are still remaining um he won those yesterday there 's also 20 000 ballots left to be counted in beaver county um,0.572,and he will in that manner bring salvation to the ever desperate world part 4 from my blog on the ark of the covenant the cathedral and the cross easter message one abridged from wikipedia the ark of the covenant was a lidded gold - leafed wooden chest containing the two stone tablets of the ten commandments according to various texts within the hebrew bible it also contained aaron 's rod and a part of manna god was said to have spoken with moses from between the two cherubim on the ark 's cover the biblical account states that the ark was created a year after the israelite exodus from egypt according to a pattern given to moses by god at the foot of mount sinai thereafter the gold - plated acacia chest was carried by its staves while enroute by the levites in advance of the people went on the march towards the promised land or at the head of the israelite army in transport the ark was concealed under a large veil made of skins and blue cloth carefully hidden even from the eyes of the priests and the levites who carried it when at rest a portable building the tabernacle meaning residence or dwelling place was set up to house the ark it was built of woven layers of curtains along with 40 eight boards clad with polished gold standing like vertical blinds solomon 's temple in jerusalem superseded it as the dwelling place of god some 300 years later commentary there has to be a bridge between the finite and the infinite there has to be a place where the ephemeral meets the eternal there has to be a bridge between the knowable and the unknowable and there has to be bedrock at the foundation the ark which is the portal to god is to be carried on the shoulders of those who are holy it is not to be touched to touch the ark is to risk death there are holy things that can not be touched except at mortal risk those things that can not be touched are at the very foundation of the community the ark must be placed at the center of the temple the temple must be placed at the center of the community the community must be arranged around what is untouchable and unshakeable the untouchable and unshakable is what is axiomatic the people following the ark have determined to journey together toward the eternal promised land the city arranged properly around the ark of the covenant is eternal jerusalem something must be axiomatic or everything shakes and falls the axiomatic can not be expressed fully in words instead the axiomatic untouchable and unshakable is what makes communication in words possible the axiomatic is a spirit a process a living force its manifestations however are concrete that is the transformation of the spirit into matter that is the generation of the tablets of stone the ark of the covenant contains the rules that are derived in the first order from the axiomatic principle that principle is the spirit that made the rules manifest that spirit is the ultimate inhabitant of the ark and the rules the result of its action that spirit is the creative logos the ark of the covenant and the temple are replaced by the cathedral at the center of the community the cathedral is the cross in architectural form the cross is where the transformation takes place the transformation is the incorporation of the body of christ that incorporation is a dramatic ritual is the embodiment of the decision not to believe in christ but to act him out which is to believe in a much deeper manner than to merely believe christ is he who transcends death by voluntarily accepting death christ is he who rejects the kingdoms of this world for the kingdom of god christ is he who speaks the truth that creates the habitable order that is good from the chaos of potential that exists prior to the materialization of reality christ is he who wields potential as the sword that cleaves death christ is he whose radical acceptance of the conditions of life defeats the hatred bitterness and vengefulness that the tragedy and malevolence that taints being otherwise produces without the acceptance of death bitterness rules and hell triumphs christ is the potential of man and woman it is said that man and woman alike are made in the image of god and that god is he who uses the eternal logos to generate habitable order from the chaos of potential this is the axiom this is the diamond at the center of the world this is the spirit in the arc that is untouchable this is the bedroom of the culture that brings peace and prosperity and that respects the dignity of man this is the great truth this is the responsibility whose acceptance allows each of us to live despite the catastrophic fragility of our limited being our likeness to god gives each of us a value that transcends the finite individual and society alike are charged with the ethical demand to respect that value this is not only the presumption that grounds the idea of the rights of man it is the presumption that lays upon each of us the ultimate responsibility that is the inevitable corollary of those rights face the chaos of the future employ the logos of which you are a part to transform that chaos into the habitable order that is good speak the truth embody the truth accept impossibly the limitations that make being possible dispense in that manner with resentment hatred and the desire for infinite and unbounded vengeance and all the cruelty and evil that accompanies it pick up the cross of your tragedy and betrayal accept its terrible weight hoist it onto your shoulders and struggle impossibly upward toward the kingdom of god on the hill the alternative is death and hell part 5 the psychological meaning of the death and resurrection of christ easter message - this is a somewhat extended and altered version of a commentary that i wrote for the london sunday times magazine in the beginning only the king was sovereign then the nobles became sovereign then with the greeks all men became sovereign then came the christian revolution and every individual male / female beggarman tax collector prostitute thief became so impossibly equally sovereign then our cultural and legal systems wrapped themselves tightly around that ultimately unlikely narrative of individual sovereignty and made it their central unshakeable pillar now we all give each other the respect of individual citizens who are sovereign without remembering or noticing that we are simultaneously accepting the proposition that every singular one of us is a divine center of logos a divine center of the eternal word that brings habitable order into being through the voluntary truthful confrontation with chaos and the unknown and if any one of us is not treated in this manner if anyone no matter how powerful reacts to any of us no matter how downtrodden as if our free will is ilusory or our role in choosing the outcomes of our lives non - existent then we get offended and angry and agitated and insulted and rightly so our spectacularly and miraculously functional western legal systems are predicated on the acceptance of the intrinsic value of the individual predicated on the idea that each person can step forward voluntarily accept the burden of being transformed positively in consequence and share the results of that transformation with everyone else it is in that manner that each of us pushes everything away from the abyss and a bit more heavenward is the apparent necessity for such insanely high regard and illusion it is certain that it is at least functional and therefore not so obviously illusory it is also equally certain that we have not outlined any more viable materialistic alternative you might well ask is the hypothesis of intrinsic human value justified is our apparent ability to face the as of yet on manifest future and decide on the nature of its realization in the present genuine and real is it true despite its prehensile ility that we are free conscious beings and then our conscious freedom plays a role in constructing the cosmos it could merely be as the cynics and reductionists hold that consciousness is an epiphenomenon of materialistic processes that there is no free will or at least none of any genuine import that there is no accompanying moral responsibility or freely chosen destiny there are however valid and not so simply dispensed with reasons to avoid too premature and casual acceptance of such conclusions even the greatest of us do not understand consciousness not a bit much less comprehend the role it plays in being we have no idea currently seriously no idea how the material substrate of the brain produces the awareness and more the self - awareness that seems so vital to the existence of the cosmos if there is no center of experience to experience something anything then it is very difficult to say in what manner that something or anything exists reality requires an observer and as far as we can tell that observer is consciousness even more so self - consciousness our awareness our self - awareness appears to confront the unformed potential of the future and to cast it into the concrete reality of the present our consciousness acts on possibility like the logos of the farther acted on the pre cosmogonic chaos at the beginning of time it is in that manner that we are made in the image of god and we all demand to be treated as if that were true and who would dare to deny that such a demand is made for valid and perhaps even ultimately valid reasons consider the evidence from our actions when you treat yourself as if you matter then you thrive when you treat those around you as if they are inhabited by a spark of divinity then your relationships stabilize and grow some dainius lee when we produce society 's predicated on the great idea of the inherent value of each individual from saint to criminal then men become free and productive and capable of living the meaningful lives that lend dignity to the tragedy of their limited existences and when we fail to do so then our society 's degenerate into the tyrannical and murderous tribal structures that seem to exist as the only certainly manifest alternative is this not all indicative of the existence of some profound truth obviously we are constrained and severely so by the manner of our corporeal being we are subject to deterministic rules in a seriously profound manner we do not have the power to shape things in any old way whatsoever at any time or place but we can certainly and demonstrably and apparently willfully advance in the direction of our imagination and in quite a staggering and compelling manner is this not indicative of who we genuinely are is this not a perhaps the primal existential truth we are in danger in the west of abandoning our culture of leaving our great foundational stories to die on the altar of our inquisitiveness cynicism and carelessness of degenerating into nihilism or returning in a reactionary manner to an archaic and destructive tribalism of the right or the left it matters not these twin dread paths will not lead us to where we would want to be if we decided to be conscious and careful such abandonment will weaken us fatally as individuals it will lay us open to possession by all manner of demonic conceptual alternatives it will make us vulnerable to our enemies within and without it is psychologically true that each of us should open ourselves up to the tragedy of being it is psychologically true that should pick up our tragic burdens and crosses die continually and renew our souls continually it may be more than psychologically true as well it may be a truth of cosmic significance that is the death and resurrection celebrated by easter and it is time for us to wake up become conscious and recognize it as such it is not possible to encapsulate within any finite written account the total import of the idea of christ 's death and rebirth the impossible claim of the bodily resurrection of one man conjoined with the notion that this event was both of world redeeming and cosmic significance simply can not be understood once and for all within any singular frame of interpretation even for die - hard atheists of the scientific type think richard dawkins and sam harris,0.3976,and if god is that i mean all of god is they do not mean a part of god that meaning jesus was a hundred percent man a hundred percent god do not mean that the father was the same man and i mean the holy spirit was the same man they were they could not be separate subjectivity to sin you all got to understand man the trinity cheapens what jesus really did because if jesus was really the ultimate the almighty god in heaven then he lied they lie when they said he was tempted because there 's no tempting god that 's impossible god can not sing at all so that was a somebody made that up if god said if jesus said the father is greater than i then was alive because the father is not greater than him if he 's god they are the same they are equal jesus should have never said that because he lied or he do not lie and you all just tryin to make him out to be a liar that 's all i am sayin man jesus really died on the cross he really had i believe jesus really had to have faith that god was one on the third day he was he shows signs of weakness the cook the father why have that forsaken me like jesus got his blood beat he was beaten like he really got beat man he really had to go to the cross having faith in god like you promised me you were raised me on the third day god i pray that you do what you said you were going to do like it was his prayer return me to my rightful position from the foundation of the earth like if there 's all the big show or he really believed it jesus fasted and praying he was all a show he was doing it just for the heck of it or jesus really had to pray he really had to fast he really was tempted by the devil and he did not fall he really had faith he really operated from hearing the voice of the father in heaven he really listened he prayed like we should be doing the reason that you do not hear because you are not praying jesus showed us that god will give you the ability by his spirit to heal the sick that is a gift of the spirit but see you do not heal whatever because you all believe this some some mysterious a story that was told no jesus already showed us how to see how to heal and how how how much to preach you should not start preaching in your ministry until you were born again jesus do not willing to know what jesus did until he was born again the 20 - some years of his life we do not know what he did it ai not even recorded in the bible when jesus did between 3 and 28 anyway same things with lucha airlines down make it making wearing masks mandatory when flying thanks trump is this maggot question mark i also feel it i guess philippians two seven through nine john eight five eight jesus is god not true do not leave me god because the word became flesh in the beginning was the word listen man listen i am telling you like i want you all to pray about this,0.6186,elizabeth warren is facing a major backlash after she accused bernie sanders of telling her a woman could not win the presidency and bernie sanders denied it it looks as though cnn at the debates were biased against bernie and still framed it as though it was true even though bernie denied it at the end of the debate she refused to shake sanders hand and now bernie sanders supporters are putting snake emojis in replies to her on twitter at the same time that bernie sanders and warren are embroiled in this conflict project veritas has released part two of their expose on bernie sanders iowa campaign staff we now see this man kyle jurek praising gulags saying that conservatives should essentially be put in them and he says many of the things that are so offensive i literally can not repeat them on my channel because youtube would actually shadow bammy now the latest update on the veritas expose is that the iowa state directors for bernie sander have begun locking down their social media i would think with only a couple weeks to the iowa caucus it would be major news that bernie 's state directors have all locked their accounts yet mums the word we hear very little from the mainstream press about this the big news apparently is that bernie sanders is sexist and that bernie sanders supporters are putting snake emojis into warrens replies and i kid you not many of warren 's defenders are saying the snake is a biblical symbol representing the evil of women therefore it proves bernie sanders is sexist but here 's the bigger picture i am going to go through these stories but it seems that both of these things show bernie and warren are kind of imploding just before the iowa caucus and the current polling aggregate has them neck and neck with biden and budaj edge in iowa one of the most important votes in primary season whoever takes this is going to set themselves apart and as we know many people like to vote based on who they think is going to win they will vote for the person they think is the winner series what i am to do i first want to talk about what 's going on with project veritas because we do now have a statement published by one of the state one of the iowa campaign staffers for bernie sanders in relation to what 's going on it would seem with project veritas i want to show you what 's going on with bernie supporters in warren and then it appears the consensus or at least many people are saying this is the democrats kind of burning themselves out both bernie and warren supporters know this scandal is going to hurt both of their campaigns at one of the most crucial times now there 's a big conspiracy theory that nancy pelosi 's impeachment was timed to hurt bernie sanders,0.9976,what are the other efforts to curtail the special counsels investigation two days after directing began to have the special counsel removed the president made another attempt to affect the course of the russia investigation on june 19 2017 the president met one - on - one in the oval office with former campaign manager and dope corey lewandowski and dictated a message for lewandowski to deliver two sessions the message said that sessions should publicly announce notwithstanding his refusal from the russia investigation that the investigation was very unfair to the president that the president had done nothing wrong and that sessions planned to meet with the special counsel and let him move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections lewandowski said he understood what the president wanted sessions to do this is the thing that comes closest to obstruction it is the president trying to tell jeff sessions that he was going to change the nature of the special counsels purview now even that is not necessarily obstruction in the sense that the president does have authority over the special counsel this is the case that alan dershowitz has made is that the special counsel does work for the executive branch from can fire him for whatever reason he wants that 's not obstruction that may be the grounds for an impeachment but that is not necessarily criminal obstruction one month later in another private meeting for lewandowski on july 19th 2017 the president asked about the status of his message for sessions to limit the special counsel investigation to future election interference lewandowski told the president the message would be delivered soon after that meeting the president publicly criticized sessions in an interview with the new york times and then issued a series of tweets making it clear that sessions his job was in jeopardy lewandowski did not want to deliver the president 's message message personally so he asked senior white house official rick dearborn to deliver it to sessions durbin was uncomfortable at the task and did not end up following through sessions never received this message his adviser advisors prevented what could have been construed as obstruction of justice right there and then there are a bunch of accusations that the president made efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence but public disclosure of evidence is not in fact a criminal offense and if i tell somebody to lied to the press that is not criminal and may be bad but trump lies to the press all the time so again baked into the cake so when the muddler investigation says that in summer 2017 the president instructed donald trump jr . to delete a line from his statement about the trump tower meeting to the press that is not actually obstruction of justice that 's just him being bad and when michael cohen repeatedly denied that the president had played any role in trump jr . statement that was lying to the public that 's bad that is not criminal hey finally the muller investigation says in early summer 2017 the president called sessions at home and again asked him to reverse his recusal from the russia investigation sessions did not reverse his refusal on october 2017 the president met privately with sessions in the oval office and asked him to take a look at investigating clinton in december 2017 shortly after flynn pled guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement the president met with sessions in the oval office and suggested according to notes taken by a senior advisor that if sessions unruh cused and took back supervision of the russia investigation he would be a hero sessions of course did not unruhe cues and the muller investigation went forward as as stated so as we say the question as to whether the president did stuff that was quote - unquote criminal here is not provable it 's not a provable question which is probably the reason that muller left it up in the air and i think attorney general barr looked at this and said there 's no way that i can prove this beyond a reasonable doubt him going to various advisors and fuming about jeff sessions and then not doing anything especially when he has the full authority to just fire whomever he wants he wants to fire jeff sessions he can fire jeff sessions if he wants to fire robert muller he can fire robert muller if he wants to order an invent when invest in end to an investigation the president can even do that right he can even order the end to an investigation without that necessarily being criminal obstruction of justice since he has in fact the president of the united states that may be impeachable it is not necessarily criminal in a second we will get to more on the muller report so the mullen report continues by talking about whether the president ordered people to lie so apparently in early 2018 the press reported that president trump had directed john mcgann to have the special counsel removed in june 2017 and that mcgann had threatened to resign rather than carry out the order the president reacted to the news stories by directing white house officials to tell mcgann to dispute the story and create a record stating that he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed mcgann told those officials that the media reports were accurate in stating that the president had directed mcgann to have the special counsel removed so again this is the president telling his to tell magan to publicly dispute the story that is not necessarily the president telling people to lie to legal investigators now if you want to broadly read the statute and a lot of this relies on sort of legalese if you want to broadly read the statute to suggest that the president was corruptly in tensing to interfere with a pending investigation by publicly tweeting things i do not think that that actually works legally speaking if the president tweets something publicly he says like i hate robert mower and then the charge is you tried to corrupt lee impede the investigation that does not work and if he told don mcgann go out and lie to the press that is also a terrible thing to do it is not a criminal thing to do the same thing holds true with regard to mike flynn and paul mann afford the suggestion that the president was publicly going around saying about flynn and manna fort and michael cohen where he was praising them,0.3658,so again there is no history to any of this and then they cite the lack of history that is being provided by the proponents of roe vs wade the opinion continues instead of seriously pressing the argument the abortion right itself has deep roots supporters of rowan casey contend the abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right road term that 's a right to privacy casey described it as the freedom to make intimate and personal choices that are quote are central to personal dignity and autonomy again the casey decision by written by justice anthony kennedy is in my opinion the single worst written supreme court decision of all time it is just pathologically stupid garbage the casey decision mean this quote is the whole thing and it 's just so dumb in casey quote at the heart of liberty is the right to define one 's own concept of existence of meaning of the universe and of the mystery of human life what the hell kind of new agey bull crap is that especially when you are talking about legislation and when you are talking about legislation that affects other interests like you know the unborn human being the court did not claim this broadly framed right is absolute no such claim would be plausible while individuals are certainly free to think and to say what they wish about existence meaning the universe and the mystery of human life they are not always free to act in accordance with those thoughts licensed to act on the basis of such beliefs may correspond to one of the many understandings of liberty but is certainly not order of liberty is alito just wood shedding justice kennedy as is well deserved in case he 's an abomination order liberty sets limits and defines the boundary between competing interests rowan casey each struck a particular balance between the interests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interest of what they termed a potential life but the people of the various states may evaluate those interests differently in some states voters may believe the abortion rate should be even more extensive than the right row in case you recognize voters in other states may wish to impose tight restrictions based on their belief that abortion destroys an unborn human being our nation 's historical understanding of order liberty does not prevent the people 's elected representatives from deciding how abortion should be regulated that is the key question right whether states get to have a say on this and the left keeps saying whatever prevents my opponents from getting their say is a good thing even if it means completely destroying the constitution in the process which is what roe and casey do now they then try to take on the idea that this is going to end with the if we get rid of roe and casey then this means that we are going to overrule loving versus virginia or griswold versus connecticut or eisenstadt versus baird or any of the rest of these cases so the court takes this on explicitly they say nor does the right to obtain an abortion have a sound bases and president casey relied on cases involving the right to marry a person of a different race the right to marry while in prison the right to obtain contraception the right to reside with relatives the right to make decisions about the education of one 's own children etc etc these attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to find one 's concept of existence prove too much okay now this is a law school phrase the idea that that is an argument that proves too much it means that the argument is so broad that it encompasses stuff that you clearly do not wish to encompass this happens all the time in law somebody will establish a principle that is way too broad for the case that is currently at hand those criteria as the court says at a high level of generality could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use prostitution and the like none of those rights has any claim to being deeply rooted in history what sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognizes recognized in the cases on which row in case you rely is something both of those decisions acknowledged abortion destroys what those decisions call potential life and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an unborn human being none of the other decisions cited by ron casey involve the critical moral question posed by abortion they are therefore in opposite so again the the critical flaw in this opinion is that it keeps over and over reinstating substantive due process as a good idea i keep coming back to this because again thomas 's concurrence is a must read thomas 's concurrence is the best exposition i think i have ever read of the of the substantive due process notion from the supreme court and why it 's so damaging to the supreme court and basically turns it into an ad hoc legislature but the court says even if you were to hold substantive due process which we do then abortion is not covered by substantive due process they say in drawing this critical distinction between the abortion right and other rights is not necessary to dispute casey 's claim that the specific practices of states at the time of the adoption of the 14th amendment do not mark the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the 14th amendment protects abortion is nothing new it 's been addressed by lawmakers for centuries the fundamental moral question that it poses is ageless defenders of rowan casey do not claim any new scientific learning calls for a different answer to the underlying moral question they do contend changes in society require the recognition of a constitutional right to obtain an abortion without the availability of abortion they maintain people will be inhibited from exercising their freedom to choose the type of relationships they desire and women will be unable to compete with men in the workplace and in other endeavors americans who believe that abortion should be restricted press countervailing arguments about modern development they note that attitudes about the pregnancy of unmarried women have changed drastically that federal and state laws ban discrimination on the basis of pregnancy that leave for pregnancy and childbirth are now guaranteed by law in many cases that the costs of medical care associated with pregnancy are covered by insurance or government assistance that states have increasingly adopted safe haven laws which generally allow women to drop off babies anonymously and that a woman who puts her newborn up for adoption today has little reason to fear the baby will not find a suitable home they also claim many people now have a new appreciation of fetal life and when prospective parents who want to have a child view a sonogram they typically have no doubt that what they see is their daughter or son both sides make important policy arguments supporters of rowan casey must show this court has the authority to weigh those arguments and decide how abortion may be regulated in the states they have failed to make that showing okay now the additional part of the of the majority opinion is the part taking on the descent,1.1705,[ music ] all right our top story today russia has launched its invasion of ukraine attacking from three sides russia overnight launched its long - anticipated attack on ukraine these troops you can see over here they are russian airborne forces they have taken this airport russia has begun a full - scale invasion of ukraine [ music ] the initial wave of russian attacks against ukraine targeted military and government facilities airfields and installations along the ukrainian border the invasion has already caused enormous damage in several reported casualties in a speech early in the morning of the invasion russian president vladimir putin warned the rest of the world whoever tries to hinder us and even more so to create threats to our country to our people should know that russia 's response will be immediate and it will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history the russian government claims to have destroyed 74 ukrainian facilities including 11 air bases during the first night of its onslaught of the eastern european nation of ukraine the announcement comes as ukraine is calling upon all international partners to assist in the war effort while providing guns to any ukrainian who wants to join the fight satellite images of an air base show extensive damage after the attacks ukraine is also reporting that it has downed a half dozen russian aircraft large explosions and missile launches were seen in videos posted on social media ukraine said that belarus which is aligned with putin assisted russia in attacking ukraine a senior ukrainian official told the wall street journal that hundreds of ukrainian soldiers died in the initial volley of attacks that number is likely to quickly rise as russian ground forces have entered ukraine and russia has launched attacks against targets in multiple cities ukrainian president vladimir zelinsky announced that he was imposing martial law across the entire territory of our state zielenski also announced on the morning of the invasion that he would give weapons to anyone who wanted to defend the country from the full - scale russian invasion the associated press reported that the russian defense minister ordered ukrainian servicemen to be treated with respect and that anyone who surrenders should be offered safe quarter meanwhile ukraine is saying that it shot down five russian fighter jets and one helicopter the russian defense ministry said that they lost one attack jet due to pilot error but so far has not commented on any other losses now russia is cracking down on their own citizens who join anti - war protests there are many russian citizens who oppose the attack on ukraine and putin has made it very clear that he will not tolerate any dissent just before the invasion the russian investigative committee which claims it investigates various corruption issues has warned its citizens not to participate in any anti - war protests on the day of the attack russia issued a statement warning that russian individuals would suffer negative legal consequences such as prosecution and criminal liability if they joined or promoted riots and rallies they went on to say it should be remembered that holding a criminal record holds negative consequences and leaves a mark on a person 's future reports indicate that more than 1500 people have been arrested at anti - war protests in russia within 24 hours of the invasion into ukraine countries and leaders around the world are reacting strongly to russia 's attack a few days before the invasion biden said that there was no chance that u.s troops would be deployed on the ground in ukraine in addition u.s troops who were already deployed to train the ukrainian military had already been removed in advance of russia 's invasion biden 's first reaction after russia attacked was a tweet it said russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring and the united states and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way the next day in a speech biden said that putin is an aggressor who chose this war putin is the aggressor putin chose this war and now he and his country will bear the consequences while biden previously said that no troops will be deployed to ukraine he now says additional military personnel will be sent to defend nato allies in europe our forces are not going to europe to fight in ukraine but to defend our nato allies and reassure those allies in the east additionally many world leaders jumped onto twitter to condemn the russian attack on ukraine including the uk germany france and canada the binding administration announced potential plans to move additional u.s troops already stationed in europe closer to ukraine as russia continues its invasion nato secretary general stoltenberg said in a statement that nato has given the u.s authority to activate its nato defense today we activated nato 's defense stance that gives our military commanders more authority to move forces and to deploy forces when needed and of course this can also be elements of the nato response force he went on to say what we do is defensive measured and we do not seek confrontation we want to prevent the conflict in addition to providing support to nato allies in eastern europe the us army personnel in poland are preparing to move near the border of ukraine to assist refugees expected to flee the country according to an army spokesperson which comes after russia launched their full - scale invasion of ukraine given putin 's strong statements and actions around the invasion the situation is likely to escalate and change rapidly follow the daily wire for all the latest updates i am brett cooper thanks for watching,0.9852,"ira it 's a smart way to

would replace joe biden on the ticket the washington post ran an oped entitled for the country 's sake vice president harris should step aside the editorial called harris a colossal failure and specifically criticized her for cackling at strange and unsettling moments now around the same time in april a cnn panel also discussed whether joe biden should ditch kel harris and again they do not just discuss her job performance which was abysmal they also cited her frequent joker likee cackling as one of the reasons that she 's so unappealing to voters watch because it 's not just focus groups that are down on harris right now in a recent poll national poll 40 % approved of the vice president 's job performance while 55 % disapproved one of the things that people objected to was her voice they said they found her voice especially her laugh annoying even the feminists on the panel conceded that kamla harris has issues communicating with voters this was an unusual moment of honesty that uh came about because at the time democrats were still fantasizing about swapping kamla harris out for a candidate the voters might actually like now of course that opportunity came and went following the coup that took down joe biden as a result these types of discussions have mostly disappeared from places like cnn and the washington post criticizing a woman 's tendency to cackle an iner times is considered sexist now because you know she might become the first female president she 's the one they are stuck with and so now all the things they were saying before are um verboten and sexist and and horrible and probably racist but the underlying issue still neverone away just because the press does not want to talk about k harris 's cackle anymore does not change the fact that most people think it 's extremely off pudding it still projects the image of an airhead or a day drinker rather than a competent presidential candidate so cnn and washington post they were right about this when they said this a few months ago and obviously she can not bring herself to stop doing it no matter how many times they have probably tried to tell her to knock it off so the comm harris campaign needed to come up with some kind of solution to this problem they had to find a way to put a positive spin on their candidates behavior especially if they were going to accuse the other side of being weird so over the past few weeks it 's clear what solution they came up with they have decided to rebrand comm harris as the candidate of joy joy so instead of disturbing voters we are now led to believe that her laugh is a completely normal and healthy sign of how happy she and her supporters actually are and so just a few months after the corporate press told us that kay harris 's laughter was one of her biggest liabilities there 's now been an incessant drum beat from the media to convince us that it 's actually somehow an asset there have been about a million uh contrived articles to this effect over the last week or two rolling stone for example declared that kla harris has adopted the politics of joy which is apparently apparently the best way to fight fascism as rolling stone put it history shows that joy and mockery are key to taking down existing or would be authoritarian regimes now never mind the fact that the nazis set up an organization called strength through joy which would seem to be a factoid from history that contradicts rolling stones thesis but never mind that meanwhile the guardian reported democrats jo is unconfined as harris and walls take upbeat message on tour the article quoted tim walls as saying quote thank you madam vice president for the trust you put in me but maybe more so thank you for bringing back the joy bringing back the joy is what kla harris has done for its part salon ran a similar headline why joy matters kla harris hopes happy women can defeat donald trump and mag 's male rage kla harris bets the election on women 's joy donald trump stakes his hopes on men 's anger now to illustrate the point even further just in case the other 10,000 articles do not drive home the message enough the new yorkers latest cover featured donald trump and jd vance looking uh uh forlorn going down on a roller coaster meanwhile k harris and tim walls are going up the roller coaster",0.7893,but i can not use it for actual transactions and instead i will just put it in bitcoin because i can still use it at the local grocery store and also it happens to hold by transactional value so the government has a couple of worries about bitcoin number one is that if people start investing in bitcoin instead of worrying about the us dollar that means there are fewer people who are buying bonds theoretically you could buy this as a holder of value over the long term and you are going to do that instead of buying government debt so the government can not actually issue more debt meaning they can not raise more money to pay for all of the various projects that they wish to engage in the other problem for government is that when you are talking about a completely digital currency that is not controlled by them and not verifiable by them they are worried about the possibility of this sort of currency for criminal use there are a thousand reasons why you might not want the government to know how you are transacting business if you happen to be a libertarian you do not think it 's the government 's business how you transact business or with whom you transact business if you are somebody who believes that the government is badly motivated and would seek to crack down on bitcoin holders for some reason or remove the value of bitcoin in some nefarious way the more closely bitcoin is protected the less government has the power to do all of that there 's always a flip side of the coin there is a pirate vibe the reason there 's a pirate vibe is because any time anybody acts entrepreneurially outside the auspices of government it feels like a pirate is doing it we have just been conditioned to think that way but these people are not criminals they are acting outside the scope and authority of the government in the sense they are creating a rival to the government 's main asset which is your full faith and credit in their system remember bitcoin goes up when faith in the system goes down if you have faith in the full faith and credit of the united states you are buying bonds if you do not have faith that the united states is not going to inflate the currency you are buying bitcoin right now cryptocurrencies are exploding facebook has its own currency you have pot coin which is pushed by i guess dennis rodman along with pistachios or something you have ethereum you have litecoin you have a bunch of different types of cryptocurrency anytime there 's a market for any sort of digital currency there will be rival digital currencies the question is which one gains credence in the marketplace it 's why at the very beginning it takes big people buying into this sort of stuff to make a difference in the market for it right the more elon musks you have buying into bitcoin the more faith there is that bitcoin is a real thing so at the beginning it does appear to be incredibly volatile whether those succeed or fail is largely and actually entirely based on the public view of whether those things are going to succeed or fail and this is why so many people are skeptical of cryptocurrencies in the first place but my feeling is that over time cryptocurrencies particularly ones that find a place in the market the way that bitcoin has i think that those are going to continue to rise i think as we have less and less faith in centralized governments and it seems to me that we are right now as that happens more and more i think you are going to see more and more people looking to diversify away from fiat currencies and instead moving into places like bitcoin for actual safety and security despite all the talk about volatility it may be that in the future the most volatile forms of currency are the ones coming from centralized governments within ax to grind as opposed to a decentralized group of people who simply wish to engage in transactions that hold their value,1.2113,he said at the time few had even thought of such an idea or were not so bold to try but later calls to pull fox news newsmax and oen from from air started to grow direct tv would later drop o in april of 2022 which accounted for 90 % of their revenue through what 's called carriage fees which are payments cable and satellite providers pay to channels on their service because being on the system is an incentive for people to subscribe the removal was celebrated by many on the left including naacp president derek johnson who called it a victory for us meaning black people and the future of democracy eliminating the free press in america helps save democracy in his mind compounding o 's problems was a lawsuit for a billion dollars by the dominion electronic voting machine company then a few months later verizon dropped them from their tv service called fios too newsmax was dropped from direct tv in january 20123 but later picked up again two months later after they came to a new agreement perhaps in part due to republicans in congress denouncing the move and people canceling their direct tv subscriptions and protest while only bringing a small fraction of fox news 's audience at the time newsmax has grown into a formidable competitor to fox and has been gaining former fox viewers who prefer newsmax because their programming tends to be further to the right and feels far less corporate and controlled after tuer carlson was fired by fox news without any reason being given even more people left fox for newsmax and it 's long overdue that we finally have viable conservative alternatives to fox especially since much to viewer shock they have kind of gone woke sometimes well june is pride month and to celebrate we are shining a spotlight on those in the lgbtq plus community who work to encourage love and acceptance of course not all the shows or hosts or rhos most are neocons though which is why sean hann has lindsy graham on every week to lobby for more money for israel and when a supposed conservative network starts celebrating pride month it 's time to change the channel a woman named gg senen who president joe biden nominated to be one of the five fcc committ commers suggested the federal communications commission should pull the broadcast license for sinclair media 's television stations a conservative leaning company that owns and operates like 300 local stations across america luckily after her hatred of conservative media went viral she withdrew her nomination claiming that she was being bullied by people on the right but the fact that such a left - wing extremist would be nominated in the first place to sit as an fcc commissioner and oversea television and radio broadcast licenses is stunning g alexandro kazio cortez called on the fcc to pull tucker carlson off the air claiming he was inciting violence but she 's so dense she does not know that the fox news channel is not governed by the fcc only over theair broadcast stations are not cable but dr carlson was fired by fox news just a few days later which she celebrated on an instagram live stream where she said that deep platforming works and used the event as a fundraiser deep platforming works and it is important and um there you go good things can happen well fox news dumped talker carlson for speaking too much truth pulling fox news from cable and satellite systems across the country is never going to happen uh let us not forget that fox news was one of the leading cheerleaders for the iraq war and the hunt for the non - existent wmds but oen did get pulled because they are too far to the right and their news and commentary is seen as more threatening to the establishment and it did happen to newsmax back when they were smaller although they returned a few months later after the backlash and the fact that democrats have even proposed the idea of banning television stations is a shocking indictment of how unamerican they are and how far they are willing to go in hopes of silencing their opposition regular viewers know i have documented the history of censorship on social media here on my youtube channel and more extensively in my books like the true story of fake news which came out in 2017 and i even warned it would start happening over a decade ago in my 2011 book big brother the orwellian nightmare come true and when the censorship on social media first started it was basically social media personalities who were not household names but who had a massed followings of hundreds of thousands of people that were getting suspended and banned little to no news articles are written about them when it happened no republican members of congress tweeted about them they were not invited on fox news for a segment to talk about it only others in their online community seem to care or notice those of us who saw the riding on the wall did our best to ring the alarm bell about the growing problem but it really was not until the hunter biden laptop story was blocked on social media and the new york post suspended from twitter back in 2020 that censorship became a major concern for the republican party they do not want to defend supposed racists like jared taylor who got banned from youtube facebook and twitter and still has not been restored on twitter x by elon musk by the way or islamophobe like laura lomer who got deep platform from basically everything including uber eats because she said some things about elon omar and islam it was only after the censorship finally reached a brand named conservative outlet that most members of congress finally broke their silence but because the first amendment only protects free speech from being censored by the government and not corporations which control communic ation technologies on social media platforms people have little recourse and are held over a barrel by selectively enforced terms of service and the whims of faceless moderators who can ban anyone they want for any reason seeing the problem early on however were numerous entrepreneurs who staly support free speech so they worked to create platforms by basically cloning the features of facebook twitter and youtube but applying the type of content moderation policies that the big tech platforms used to have before they started massively restricting what people are allowed to post and while rumble gab getter true social miwe telegram and others have not gained the widespread user bases of the big tech platforms millions of people use them and they are invaluable tools for free speech despite how niche they may seem the washington post ran an article complaining about congresswoman marjorie taylor green 's reach on the alt tech platforms after her personal twitter account was banned in early 2020 for repeated violations of their covid misinformation policy the post was stunned that she continued to reach hundreds of thousands of people her twitter account was among those later restored by elon musk but that 's beside the point they were so out of touch they thought that by banning her twitter account she was just going to go away obviously elon musk has done tremendous things to move the overton window and allow a wide variety of discussions about topics that had previously been forbidden not to mention restoring thousands and thousands of baned account many of which were quite popular james o'keefe car dam laura lomer alex jones although elon did hold out for alex for over a year but he finally came around and of course donald trump 's account but because of the immense opposition to elon allowing so many once banned users and topics like misgendering trans people and questing the safety of certain vaccines and surprisingly accounts that are basically dedicated to criticizing israel things that were strictly forbidden under the previous ownership and is a violation of the terms of service on all the other big tech platforms and with elon being largely blamed for donald trump winning the 2024 presidential election it 's going to be difficult for elon to sustain enough revenue sources to keep the app financially viable in the face of ongoing advertiser boycotts and attempts to sabotage him and he faces the very real risk of the app being banned from the duopoly of the big tech app stores hopefully he realizes this but as brilliant as he is he has made some very obvious and very big mistakes like selling verification badges to people without actually verifying their identity remember that less than 24 hours later he paused the new verification system scheme after rash of impersonation accounts became verified then he tried to increase revenue through subscription services like twitter blue now called x premium which gives users a verification check mark and some other features like the ability to post longer tweets instead of the standard 280 characters and edit them after they are posted and a higher tier which makes it ad free and gives users access to grock which is elon 's version of chat gpt but despite elon 's bringing on board a new ceo from the advertising industry linda yakar rino the company has struggled financially and if you use twitter x whatever it may forever be known as twitter calling it x was the worst rebrand in history but that 's a whole other story if you use twitter then you know most of the advertisers are not exactly high quality brands most of the ads are awful quite frankly so awful that many of them even get community noted or fact checked with the notice that the products are ripoffs or scams so then he tried to turn it into youtube where people can get paid to tweet and users can get some ad revenue share from the ads that show up in their reply threads and well that may sound like a good idea it has actually turned the platform into a cess poool of content thieves and engagement farmers so now people are just downloading old viral clips of anything and everything and posting them hoping to get people to start talking about them so that they can get the ad revenue from the engagement people who typically tried to build a brand as a political person now just post random crap consisting of old fail videos and clips of old pranks or feminist meltdowns that went viral years ago and steal other people 's memes just to get the engagement,0.2824,quote an amendment to the prep act stipulates that companies quote can not be sued for money damages in court close quote over injuries caused by medical countermeasures for covet such counter measures include vaccines therapeutics and respiratory devices close quote the only exception to this immunity would be if death or serious physical injury is caused by willfully willful misconduct indemnification for vaccines was as discussed above not unique what was new was that the companies producing them were indemnified before the vaccine was even made and fully assassed knowing it would all be done faster than ever before as the nation agonized over mounting deaths the race for a vaccine was moving quickly if too opaquely for some in september 2020 a number of scientists began openly worrying about the non - transparency of the vaccine trials and whether this could wind up affecting vaccine hesitancy the new york times ran several articles on this reporting that astrazeneca pfizer and moderna had each withheld their study protocols from outside scientists and the public withholding protocols guarantees that outside researchers can not know how participants are selected or monitored and how effectiveness or safety are defined so that they can not really know what exactly is being studied pharma companies have traditionally argued that not only the trial patients but the clinical trial data belong to them that it 's proprietary even though the study 's results impact millions this is part of a kind of traditional secrecy in the field delaying protocol release conveniently means that it is a company 's press releases not the verified science that dominate the public 's all - important initial impression of its product that the government regulatory agencies go along with all this it is in fact standard practice does not assuage the public for many it makes the whole process appear corrupt and it does not help that according to the conflict of interest disclosures of the authors of the pfizer and moderna vaccine clinical trials some of the authors are employed by these companies and often have stock options the essence of the scientific method is conducting experiments that everyone can objectively see and verify transparency is the bedrock of experimental science and the means to ultimately dispel doubt moreover in terms of the scale of public involvement the experience of the summer and fall of 2020 was unlike any other in the history of medicine never before had studies of this size and consequence been run so quickly or a medicine been produced so quickly to be given to hundreds of millions of people these studies were called phase 3 clinical trials and if they had positive results then the vaccine could be given to hundreds of millions of people on the basis of an fda emergency use authorization but how long were the patients followed in these two studies after their second dose to assess safety and efficacy two months on that basis the vaccines were given to over a hundred million people one must not confuse the perhaps immaterial fact that the vaccines were made quickly from the arguably more important fact that they were tested on people for only a short time these vaccines were developed so quickly in part because the new mrna technology allows quicker production and because parts of the production lines that in the past were staged out over time were in this case set up simultaneously with the help of huge cash infusions all else being equal there 's a serious argument that it might be hugely advantageous to be able to produce new vaccines so quickly quote if you can intervene with let us say a forty percent effective vaccine four months before you can intervene with an eighty percent effective vaccine you save more lives with the forty percent effective vaccine that 's delivered four months earlier close quote barney graham of the national institutes of health pointed out quote being fast in an outbreak setting in some ways is more important than being perfect close quote still it was obvious as early as the fall that some testing steps would be skipped quote we will have less safety testing than we typically would have close quote gates noted quote we just do not have the time close quote must that be a problem why especially during a pandemic would not we want to quickly distribute any vaccine that appears to work even somewhat effectively to those who are willing to take on any potential risks that may go with less safety testing some people might even decide for themselves that a raging pandemic is a dangerous enough threat to outweigh every other possible concern but what we should not do if we want to maintain public trust and cohesion is act as though there is no chance that any legitimate concern could ever possibly emerge or that we know more than we really do after only two months of study with complex biological systems we simply can not presume that just because we have a fantastic idea for a treatment the safety we hope for and see at the start will necessarily hold over time take the classic example of thalidomide it was originally a sedative used for anxiety and later tried for nausea it worked leading some to theorize that it could prevent nausea in pregnant mothers in practice once on the market it did but it also caused serious birth defects in children it took longer than nine months and enough cases to realize that these side effects came from the drug and even more time to overcome the drug companies opposition to the facts the same applies to any of the major drugs pulled off the market for causing cancer heart attacks and diabetes they do not always cause dire consequences immediately or in everyone sometimes these drugs set a process in motion immediately but it takes scientists a year or many years to pick up the trend in a population at large working from first scientific principles and based on what we already know we can often develop a neat theory about what might work but because we do not know what we do not know it often does not turn out as we expect that is why empirical science developed as a way to test our theories empirical science is always by definition science after the fact this is especially important given the specific kind of vaccine that was being approved in the united states the mrna vaccine which was a first of its kind instead of exposing a person to the virus itself in attenuated live form like the mmr or killed form like the polio shot or flu shot which is how many of the other vaccines we have come to know work in the mrna vaccine a person is exposed to an artificially made genetic messenger mrna that goes into their cells and directs them to make part of the virus which then triggers antibodies early on in the rollout both the pharma pr industry and the press emphasized how novel these vaccines were and how this unique technique would produce a vaccine so quickly but when some side effects started to emerge and people got nervous officials and the company 's own pr teams changed their message these techniques were now presented as not new at all but as having been around a long time the hesitant notice flip - flops in communication like this at best it makes them wonder about the lasting veracity of public health messages at worst it makes them deeply suspicious over the course of the summer of 2020 while the clinical trials were ongoing outside scientists still had no access to what exactly was being measured and hence studied so there was no external check - on or observation of the process despite much of the research having been funded by government marketing and distribution would be done by the government the government would be providing the customers and the government would even pay for the consequences of safety problems that might arise withholding protocols rather than disseminating them as widely as possible was under such circumstances a sign of outlandish and the governmental agencies that are supposed to advocate for the public in this case the fda cdc and nih countenanced it in september 2020 one bit of secrecy was lifted it turned out that astrazeneca had stopped its clinical trial twice the first pause was not even announced the second one was but neither the uk public nor the fda nor scientists were immediately told why before they ever found out however astrazeneca ceo pasqual soriat did privately disclose the reason two cases of serious neurological damage to the j.p morgan investment bank to some this said much about who exactly this process was designed to benefit quote the communication has been horrible and unacceptable close quote vaccine advocate virologist peter hotez said quote this is not how the american people should be hearing about this close quote scientists started to demand to see the protocols hotes and others quote criticized obtuse statements released by government officials including uk regulators who he said failed to supply a rationale for resuming their trials close quote government officials and the regulators who most citizens assume are there to keep the process honest seemed instead to be partners in the obfuscation in november 2020 the exciting news arrived we had vaccine liftoff phase 3 trials of the pfizer and moderna vaccines were said to be 95 and 94.5 percent efficacious as fouchy and the company press releases announced and the emergency use authorization was granted on the basis of these two - month studies allowing distribution of the vaccines to millions efficacious is the term used to describe how effective a treatment is in the artificial situation of a clinical trial with volunteer patients a group not always representative of the wider population effective is the term used to describe how a treatment works in the real world the media quickly assumed the two were the same to them hearing that a vaccine was 95 efficacious meant it was practically perfect which the press repeated over and over but what exactly were the vaccines efficacious at doing stopping viral transmission preventing severe illness or reducing hospitalization or icu admissions preventing death efficacious for how long and efficacious in whom in the elderly who were most vulnerable to death without clear definitions and answers to these questions typical of much of the coverage americans only had a limited idea really of what these vaccines had been shown to do in the narrow universe of clinical trials let alone what they do when given to the public in fact they do not receive answers to a single one of these questions moreover there was still a cloud of mystery surrounding the trials after pressure mounted in the wake of the astrazeneca revelation in september the four major western vaccine manufacturers finally released their protocols each over a hundred pages long after the protocols were released peter doshi an associate editor at the british medical journal who does research into drug approval processes and how results are communicated to the public try to sound an alarm quote none of the trials currently underway are designed to detect a reduction in any serious outcome such as hospital admissions use of intensive care or deaths close quote he said only one of the studies of the oxford astrozenica looked at whether vaccinated individuals were less likely to transmit virus by doing weekly pcr swabbing vaccinated people had lower viral loads were less likely to have a positive covet test and were positive for shorter durations very good news indeed though not automatically applicable to the other mrna vaccine studies,0.9783,last month in birmingham in the uk hundreds of muslims protested a local school when they found out the school was teaching their children about lgbtq issues many of the parents said it was confusing their kids it was offensive or that some of their friends had already left the country because they do not want their kids learning about these things in furtherance of their protest they withdrew hundreds of students from the school and this would seem to have forced the school to end the lgbtq curriculum a lot of people understand there are nations in this world that criminalize homosexuality sometimes it 's even punishable by death yet for some reason you have a faction of individuals in the west who believe that this conservative religious community can intersect with the lgbtq community but as we have seen in birmingham it is not always true while it 's true for the most part in the united states we will still see more issues like this today let us take a look at exactly what 's going on with the school in the protest and i want to go over some issues that countries have in terms of criminalizing homosexuality but before we get started follow me on minds at minds.comcast we are also setting up a distributed newsroom over on our subverse page where you can get involved to share stories and highlight information you think needs to see more light if you want to support these videos just share them on social media to help spread the message the story is actually really complicated and there are people making accusations in all directions but we saw this a few days ago birmingham school stops lgbt lessons after parents protest now i will come back to this but let us look at why this happened back in february we saw this story from the daily mail education not indoctrination muslim parents lead group of 300 in protest outside school gates against equality lessons on homosexuality and gender they say more than 300 parents and children gathered outside of a primary school yesterday to protest against lessons on homosexuality and gender some muslim demonstrators said they would rather leave the uk than allow their children to continue attending parkfield community school in birmingham pupils were kept out of lessons for the first hour of the day some joined in with chants and held placards reading education not indoctrination one child carried a handwritten sign which said let kids be kids in this image posted by the daily mail you can see what they say some muslim demonstrators said they would rather leave the uk than allow their children to continue attending parkfield community school in birmingham parkfield community school has said it wants peoples to be accepting and to welcome anybody in this image you can see many different signs from this particularly religious community my child my right my child my choice say no to no outsiders program stop now respect and be respected this is an image of protesters saying no to an lgbtq curriculum one sign says it 's exploiting children 's innocence another says say no to undermining parental rights and authority the protest comes amid a campaign against lessons on equality at the school with parents in the predominantly muslim area saying they promote homosexuality christian evangelists joined them to protest yesterday in a show of solidarity parents anger is aimed at the school 's assistant head andrew moffett who was behind the no outsiders lessons he created the scheme to teach children about the equality act and british values mr moffett who is in a civil partnership was made an mbe for services to equality and diversity in education in 2017 he is currently shortlisted for a world 's best teacher award he resigned from a previous teaching post at another school after a row with christian parents over lessons challenging homophobia and is now facing even more vocal complaints from parents at parkfield where 98 of the 750 pupils are said to be from islamic backgrounds one protester miriam ahmed said what they are teaching is not right they are too young there are nine parts of the act and they only seem to be focusing on one homosexuality and that is wrong they need to have an ethos which reflects the area it 's not just because we are muslims there are christians here too we do not have a vendetta against homosexuals and we respect the act we respect that mr moffatt is gay and we are happy for him to teach she said she would consider taking her daughter out of school full time if the lessons continued claiming children were being affected emotionally and psychologically one father whose six - year - old daughter attends the school said his wife wanted to leave the country rather than let her daughter attend the lessons the man who did not want to be named said my daughter has been asking questions my wife did not know how to answer the latest update from march 4th birmingham school stops lgbt lessons after parents protest hundreds of children withdrawn from parkfield community school for day the story says a primary school that taught pupils about homosexuality as part of a program to challenge homophobia has stopped the lessons after hundreds of children were withdrawn by parents in protest parkfield community school in salt lee birmingham has been the scene of weekly protests over the lessons which parents claim are promoting gay and transgender lifestyles in a letter to parents the school said up to the end of this term we will not be delivering any no outsiders lessons in our long - term year curriculum plan as this half term has already been blocked for religious education equality assemblies will continue as normal and our welcoming no outsiders ethos will be there for all on friday about 600 muslim children aged between 4 and 11 were withdrawn from the school for the day parents said the school would not confirm the number what we end up seeing here should not be surprising to anybody who 's followed abrahamic religious protests in the past in the u.s for the longest time it was the christian community that opposed gay rights that opposed gay marriage so it 's not surprising then to see another religious group of people protesting lgbt education and in fact being joined by christians the reason that i think this is important is that there are people in the us and in the uk and other western countries that are critical of christianity when it comes to lgbt issues but are very accepting of muslims or they would defend them or deny that muslims actually hold very similar views to christians the reality is islam is an abrahamic religion not too dissimilar from judaism or christianity and any conservative religious group will likely oppose lgbt issues thus we are seeing this now we went through this in the 90s and the 2000s with conservative christians in the us and we have gotten past this in fact many republicans now are in favor of gay rights and gay marriage and trump even unfurled an lgbt flag at one of his events but the reality is in certain countries that adhere to abrahamic religious values they actually criminalize homosexuality and so that means we have to be aware that if many people come from these countries they will hold these more conservative views on lgbtq issues this article from outlife.org uk says which countries criminalize homosexuality if you are lesbian or gay and traveling abroad it 's sensible to check the laws governing sex and sexuality in whichever country you are visiting dozens of countries still imprison lgbtq plus people and nine still threaten the death penalty we can see that there are many nations that will give you life in prison some 20 years 17 15 and while they are not all necessarily islamic some of them are some of them are not when it comes to countries that will put you to death for being lgbtq plus they are all muslim we have mauritania for muslim men only nigeria in the northern states that approve sharia law in sudan in qatar somalia iran saudi arabia yemen and the islamic state they are absolutely modern muslim communities that do not want to criminalize homosexuality that respect the rights but even then when you have migrants who come to say the uk while they are not going to be nearly as extreme as many of those countries they still will be at odds with the lgbt community,0.7516,so if you want to stop school shootings it 's not enough just event and march it 's necessary to let people from red america lead the way and to show respect to gun owners at all points there has to be trust and respect first then we can strike a compromise on guns as guns and not some sacred cross in the culture war this of course is a hundred percent true one of the reasons that no agreement has been reached here is that gun owners will say why do not we talk about these issues that have nothing to do with guns and less will say i do not want to talk about any of those issues you are just doing that because you wanted to strap from guns and the right will say gun owners will say to the left well the only reason you want to talk about guns is because you hate guns it 's not because you actually think this is going to prevent school shootings you have provided no evidence that this will prevent school shootings other than a mass gun confiscation like a regime in australia or britain where the sample size is too small to really identify it anyway the number of school shootings in australia prior to the gun ban the gun confiscation the gun buyback program was so low that when it went to zero that is within margin of error but the left has a real stake in avoiding the consequences of having real discussions about real issues and the right knows that people on the right gun owners feel insulted by this as well they should when abc shows that video of that guy cutting his gun in half and then suggests to me a law - abiding gun owner than if i were a good person i would saw my gun in half my answer is no if i were a good person i would maintain my gun keep it in good working condition and shoot bad guys when they attempt to shoot innocent people it 's always the cops who take down these folks by the way it 's always people with guns who take down mass shooters it is always the threat of another gun that stops a mass shooter in the end that 's why it 's so foolish to to cast doubt on all law - abiding gun owners now you want to talk about measures that you can take because you think that they are reasonable with regard to buying guns and owning guns you are going to have to show number one how that connects to the issue at hand school shootings and number two you are going to have to explain why it why it is that gun violence in the united states has been dramatically declining for the last two decades despite skyrocketing numbers of guns in circulation in the united states the rate of gun ownership has gone down overall,0.9057
"so the pareto distribution governs all sorts of other things too , i mentioned it governs the popularity of books the sales of books but it also , it also characterizes the distribution of everything that people produce , so if you think of creative production of any sort , artistic production , industrial production it does not matter , almost everything fails and a few things succeed beyond anyone 's wildest imagination apples ' a good example of that , you know i mean , the iphone , they have their competitors but it is an extraordinarily dominant product , and they rake in billions of dollars do not know if apple is valued at a trillion dollars but it 's close to that , and that is a lot of money , and i think if i remember correctly , it something like this , i probably have the figures wrong but the top 40 people , the richest 40 people in the world have as much money as the bottom 2 billion right , now , you know it not like they are stuffing their mattresses with that money or they have a skyscraper full of cash , that money is out in the economy doing whatever money does , so you can not spend 28 billion dollars so , and sometimes you can even do some good with it , you know , bill gates seems to be doing something reasonable with his money , but the reason i am telling you this is because one of the things you should know is that this proclivity for inequality is pervasive among the products of human beings it is the case with the goals scored in hockey , my son told me and he is a reliable source on hockey statistics , that if wayne gretzky , if you do not count any of the points that wayne gretzky managed with scoring , he still had enough points just with assists to have more points than any hockey player that ever played , so , you know , even at the upper end of the distribution there is some person whose , aahh , that is so good at what they do , and then there is another person that is so much better than them that it is not even comparable and so , and the benefits flow to people who are in that position , and you can understand why , i would say because you know , say you start writing , and you get a book and rare things , very rare things to have happen , and some people read it and they like it and then of course it is much more likely that you will get a next book and if people like that then it is even more likely that you will get a third book and then people start to know who you are and then because they know who you are , they phone you up and offer you opportunities and your network grows , it 's like this exponential increase in your reach and your capacity for production , and more and more flows to you , and then on the other hand if you start to fail , and you know , why would someone fail , well god , one idea that is very common in our culture is that poverty is caused by lack of money and that 's a very stupid idea , because money is very difficult to handle , i had clients who were drug addicts , and the worst possible thing that could happen to them is that they got some money they are just done , first of all , they were hanging around with people who were a little on the sociopathic side and so , especially if they were not that bright and could not defend themselves very well as soon as they got money , well it was off to the bar with all the friends , and , you know , one guy i remember in particular , you know every time he got his , his disability check , he was gone for 5 days , you would find him in a ditch , you know , because he would go to the bar , spend every cent he had on alcohol and cocaine , and , wake up in a ditch ¾ 's dead , well , eventually completely dead , and , you know then he was ashamed and horrified and repentant and he would straighten himself out again and then that was all well and good , until , as long he was broke until the next check showed up , and then , bang the same thing , so , you know , it 's not like money is necessarily a good for everyone it 's hard to manage money , it 's really easy for it to disappear , i mean elderly people have a hell of a time now because you know , crooks are contacting them on the internet non - stop , and so just giving people money money it 's like , it 's like pouring water in their hands it 's not that helpful , not necessarily that helpful , and then of course , contributors to poverty are , well , it 's not that helpful to have a low iq you know , people do not like the idea of iq because it seems so arbitrary , you know , have a high iq",0.1479,i am going to make the case for president trump along the lines of his policies we are going to talk about all the things that trump has done because i understand all the media i want to talk about is all the dumb stuff trump tweets the hard job in the media is actually digging down into the stuff that is actually happening on the presidential level because the fact is the trump administration 's record has been wildly successful i mean extremely successful on domestic policy on foreign policy on regulatory policy on economic policy let us start with president trump and his and his domestic policy trump has been wildly successful his economic record is virtually unparalleled for the last half century americans were doing unprecedentedly well under donald trump 's economy until coveted hit and the reason for that is obvious donald trump cut taxes donald trump cut regulations donald trump created an environment where people felt safe and secure investing in their workers investing in their business or the tax cuts the tax cuts cut taxes for people across the board which is why now joe biden when he says he 's going to repeal the trump tax cuts he finally admitted he means he 's only going to repeal part of the trump tax cuts because it turns out that those trump tax cuts helped pretty much everybody on the income spectrum cut regulation cut taxes used his presidential power to appoint originalist judges to the best of his ability i mean like hundreds and hundreds of them this was a major thing judge neil gorsuch judge brett kavanaugh judge amy coney barrett so was that a surprise president trump has also appointed pro - life people to the executive branch and he 's pursued pro - life policies so for example he reinstated the mexico city policy to prevent taxpayer funding of abortions overseas he signed an executive order stating that faith - based employers and organizations like little sisters of the poor could not be forced to violate religious beliefs to comply with obamacare remember the obama administration literally sued nuns in order to get them to cover contraceptive care remember this he restored due process on college campuses the trump administration has been very supportive of police across the country unlike the obama administration which crammed down ridiculous consent decrees that achieved nothing then we get to what i think may be actually the most important accomplishment of the trump administration and i know that trump has been bashed to hell and back over his coveted response the reality is no one on the left can explain what they would have done differently but it was trump they created operation warp speed and its democrats who are now saying that they will not approve any vaccine approved by trump it was it was trump who got the ppe and the ventilators where they needed to go the most important accomplishment that trump made during kova though was that he refused to take control via the federal government of every aspect of americans life you know if a democrat were in charge we would have been talking about national lockdowns the fact that trump 's first response to the single greatest opportunity for a government power grab of my lifetime was not to make that power grab is a great indicator he is not quite the fascist or tyrant that the left likes to make him out to be now it 's time to get to the even better stuff that he 's done which is his foreign policy trump 's foreign policy has been excellent like really really good donald trump has rebuilt the military we have sunk enormous sums of cash into rebuilding the military at the same time he 's actually created unprecedented peace and prosperity in regions that have not seen it in quite a while so his most obvious accomplishments have been in the middle east on a personal level i have great appreciation as a jew for the fact that donald trump moved the embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem this was actually the the beginning point of a break out of peace in the middle east that we have not seen in several decades something which said could not be done this deal is a significant step towards building a more peaceful secure and prosperous middle east that was obviously a historic moment he 's not gotten proper credit for that if barack obama had done it he would have won his second nobel prize given that he won one just for breathing and being a human donald trump is responsible for the killing of al - baghdadi the head of isis in the middle east after the obama administration turned isis from the so - called jv team that 's how obama described them into an actual regional power i mean they had they controlled territory larger than the size of the uk he dumped out of the idiotic iran deal trump also dumped out of the idiotic paris accords the left one nuts over it and the fact is again the paris accords were completely useless they were an empty piece of paper they were a big nothing furthermore president trump recognized china as a threat on foreign policy i think it is also worth noting that donald trump has not started any new wars is not that kind of a thing i mean there 's not been a president in my lifetime who has not started any new wars but for a guy who 's supposed to be a tyrannical warmonger he does not seem like all that much of a tyrant or a warmonger trump has actually lessened the amounts of control the federal government exerts over your life domestically and he has lessened america 's reliance on war making on foreign policy,0.5082,well liberals claim to be adamantly against racism the truth is they embrace and openly encourage racism against white people while at the same time pretending that it does not exist or justifying it as payback for some people owning slaves 150 years ago well white people 's careers are often ruined for a joke that black people find offensive remember what happened to roseanne barr or for just pointing out certain undisputed facts overt racism and hatred of white people is not only tolerated today it 's celebrated many people refer to anti - white racism as reverse racism or reverse discrimination which are deceptive terms because they imply that racism and discrimination are just one - way streets and something that 's only carried out by whites against blacks mexicans and other minorities those who are intellectually honest acknowledge and understand that racism is something every ethnic group experiences because of humans hardwired tribal nature and the cultural differences between groups of people and the conflicts those differences cost critical race theory is another deceptive term which only obfuscates or masks what 's really going on when people hear about racism they have been conditioned to wrongly think that it 's aimed only at blacks from whites this is why the term anti - whitism should be used and should become part of the modern lexicon but be careful i am sure it will not be long before the adl and southern poverty law center add anti - whitism to their list of white supremacist terms just like they did with the innocuous it 's okay to be white slogan if you simply say that they will label you an alt - right neo - nazi after all wikipedia says those are the only people who talk like that the adl is actually trying to change the definition of the word racism on their website they literally defined it as quote the marginalization and or oppression of people of color based on a socially constructed hierarchy that privileges white people their very definition of racism is racist all the more reason why the term anti - whitism should be used to more clearly illustrate what 's happening the adl updated it after news went viral of their orwellian definition but their sentiment remains the same not to mention calling it critical race theory throws people off making them think it 's not real it 's just a theory anti - whitism is all too real unfortunately so that 's the term that should be used to describe it i have never heard anybody use it though and it certainly is not in any online dictionary yet it could be by the end of the year however if enough people start calling it out when they see it remember when the word twerking was added to the dictionary the dictionary adds new words every year and this one is long overdue it just popped into my head one day as shorthand for anti - white racism in the same vein as anti - semitism a term everyone is familiar with when one word is used as a noun to describe something it has much more power than a bunch of words trying to describe it so again stop calling anti - whitism critical race theory and call it what it really is or at least if you use the term critical race theory clarify what it really is to help educate people and wean them off of such a deceptive term and while racism of any kind should be equally denounced sadly it 's very common for certain people and the liberal media to accept anti - whitism as if that form of racism is somehow justified one columnist for affinity magazine wrote an entire article titled why black people are allowed to be anti - white and cited slavery as the reason which was abolished 150 years ago anti - whitism is increasingly being institutionalized with a disturbing number of college professors and entire courses dedicated to painting the white race as a problem democrats are always adding fuel to this fire by labeling republicans the party of white men and equating trump supporters with neo - nazis and anti - whitism is putting police officers lives at risk because online activists perpetuate fake news that police departments across the country are filled with white supremacists who are looking for an opportunity to beat down or arrest black people such propaganda has sparked a rash of ambushes on random white police officers by unhinged thugs who gunned them down when they least suspected it while our country has a checkered past in regards to slavery and the treatment of non - whites most liberals not only live in the past and blame injustices from hundreds of years ago on white people living today but they themselves are openly racist against white people maybe we should point out to them that africa is the slavery capital of the world with millions of men women and children living in modern slavery not to mention it was black people who enslaved other black people in africa and sold them to white people who then brought them to north america thankfully for the most part today we can co - exist alongside one another in america despite our cultural differences but in recent years we have seen a dramatic rise in anti - whitism and new buzzwords have entered the lexicon like white privilege and white normative which are used to perpetuate anti - white racism websites like the huffington post at buzzfeed along with cnn and msnbc contributors take things even farther by claiming that only white people can be racist and even blame white people for ruining america for everyone else they use mental gymnastics by claiming that non - whites can not be racist because they supposedly have no institutional power and have redefined racism as a combination of power and prejudice blacks have no power they say despite a black man recently being president of the united states every government agency social media platform celebrity and fortune 500 company catering to black lives matter and openly encouraging anti - whitism the marxists are even pushing the idea that all white people are beneficiaries of racism even if they themselves are not racist this results in white privilege they say and white people are now encouraged to check their privilege meaning acknowledging the role that these supposed rewards play in their lives and the lives of less privileged people white people who are not racist at all are given advantages in america because of other white people 's racism they claim it 's not an exaggeration to say that there is a cultural war on whiteness and that white people are being systematically demeaned and blamed for the personal and professional shortcomings and failures in other people 's lives we also see an epidemic of fake hate crimes in order to use the attention as leverage to further this cause many people are even seeing acts of racism where none exist hallucinating like schizophrenics it 's interesting that while white people are said to be the supposed privileged race in the united states asians actually have the highest average income liberals do not like facts though white people must not only ignore uncomfortable facts about crime out of wedlock births and fatherlessness in black communities or be labeled a racist but also put them on a pedestal as special not to mention apologize be ashamed simply for being white the leftists rampage against what they call white america keeps growing they began demanding that confederate monuments be removed but once they were all taken down they moved on to statues of christopher columbus and now the founding fathers george washington and thomas jefferson have to go to they say they even want to tear down mount rushmore as this vice news article shows titled let us get rid of mount rushmore and they are 100 serious they want it demolished even before all this madness i could see what was on the horizon and back in 2015 conducted a social experiment where i asked random beachgoers to sign a petition to support issuing a new american flag design telling them that since the stars and stripes are synonymous with slavery the country needed a new flag for the new world order i recommended a rainbow pyramid to represent diversity and many gladly signed the petition and looked forward to replacing old glory there 's so much more i want to tell you but the thought police may be watching so you will have to read my books that way they can not take a sound bite of me saying something out of context and twist it around to cast me in a false light so order my book liberalism find a cure which is not just an awesome t - shirt i sell at markdays.com but also a very serious book i wrote that details what the liberal agenda is doing to our society so ordered a paperback from amazon.com or download the ebook from any of the major ebook stores kindle ibook nooks google play et cetera and of course there 's a link to the amazon listing in the description below so click it and head on over there and check it out,0.2554,but he was delirious and spitting whether or not that counts as resisting is up for interpretation i suppose none of these men were just walking innocently down the street or sitting on a park bench somewhere minding their own business none can be called law abiding in none of these cases is there any apparent or uh apparent connection to or evidence of racism or racial profiling in all of these cases police were called to the scene because the actions because of the actions taken by the suspects which had raised varying degrees of perfectly justified alarm among the public these cases far from proving that there is an epidemic of police killing or brutalizing innocent people actually provide very strong evidence for the opposite conclusion there is no such epidemic in fact it would appear that a person has to make a series of very bad choices in order to run any significant risk of a violent encounter with police as i have previously demonstrated a wider view of the issue leads to the same conclusion take 2019 throughout all of 2019 police arrested around 10 million suspects 70 were white um uh 30 were black a total of 14 of the 3 million black people arrested and and or rather killed during an arrest were unarmed only six of those cases really count as unarmed when you read the details remember again this is out of three million arrests only one titania jefferson was an entirely innocent person minding her own business gunned down by police randomly while sitting in her house there 's nothing she could have done different obviously fortunately the police officer has been charged with murder there was a similar case in 2018 when botham jean was was killed by an off - duty cop while he was sitting in his own apartment that officer went to prison this year there was briana taylor though in that case she was killed in the crossfire when her boyfriend fired on police during a no - knock no knock raid it 's not exactly the same as the jefferson and jean cases but even if you want to put it in the same category we are looking at about what one instance every year out of millions and millions of police arrests and interactions in the vast majority of police shootings they are responding to lethal aggression from the suspect it would seem that the six high profile cases from this summer are pretty accurate representations of the larger trend actually uh blm and their allies certainly seem to think so which is why they are rioting based on those cases so then what can we learn from them how might a person who wants to avoid getting shot and or killed by police choose to behave what could all of these men have done differently a blueprint emerges if you want to give yourself like a 99.99999 or even larger probably chance of not dying at the hands of police all you need to do is one avoid committing crimes two if you are going to commit them avoid doing them while high on lethal doses of narcotics three avoid assaulting police four avoid pulling weapons on police five avoid resisting arrest now it 's safe to say that if if almost everyone that you know almost everyone in modern american history who has followed these five steps has not died at the hands of police they all have or will die of something else but police will not be the cause if you follow these steps the list of things that is more likely to kill you regardless of race is extremely lengthy and includes things like lightning strikes bear attacks meteors this is not to say that everyone who fails to follow steps one two and five deserves to be killed by cops i mean even those who fail to follow three and four avoid assaulting police avoid pulling weapons on police they do not necessarily deserve it because deserve is not a relevant word here the police officer who shot ricardo munez was not trying to give munoz what he deserves he was simply trying to neutralize an imminent threat to his own life so this is not about deserve but it is about consequences actions have consequences a very likely consequence of pulling a weapon on a police officer is that you get shot getting shot by a cop is not a statistically likely consequence of committing a crime in the first place i mean most people commit crimes do not get shot but your chances of that happening are now as a consequence higher than they would have been had you committed no crime at all with each bad choice the consequences pile up and the likelihood of a disastrous outcome is heightened so when you go through steps one through one through five there if if if you do the opposite rather than avoiding the committing committing the crime you commit it rather than avoiding uh you know resisting arrest you resist arrest as you do as you make each of those mistakes as i should say as you make each of those choices um the likelihood of a disastrous cataclysmic outcome a fatal outcome for yourself is heightened if you are just you are just adding to the list as you go down you do none of those things if you actually follow the steps you avoid doing all of that almost certainly for everyone in america almost certainly 99.9999 if not more your chances are you will be fine you will not be killed by the cops now even if you think that there 's an epidemic of racist police out hunting and murdering people which there is not but even if you think that 's the case this should still be your message this is not a blm this is not their message they do not want to talk about this,0.6533,they treated sunrail mice they poured a bunch of money into hunter 's pocket this is going all the way back to 2008 when it was not considered verboten to report on joe biden 's corruption meanwhile at the same time as michelle malkin once reported for national review joe biden was involved in some sweetheart real estate deals with folks over at mbna according to malkin circa 2010 former senior senator from delaware and current vice president joe biden has a custom - built house in delaware 's ritziest chateau country neighborhood it is now worth at least 2.5 million dollars and is the biden 's most valuable asset biden taps campaign funds to pay for his compound 's law needs he secured the new estate with the help of a corporate executive who worked for biden 's top campaign donor credit card giant mbna in 1996 biden sold his previous mansion to mbna chair vice chairman john cochran the asking price was 1.2 million dollars cochran forked over the full sum biden then paid 350 grand in cash for real estate developer keith stoltz for a 4.2 acre lakefront lot stoltz had paid that same amount five years earlier for the undeveloped property stoltz told the wilmington news journal the residential real estate market was soft at the time he sold the land of biden soft for whom stoltz do not need to sell the property reporter byron york looked at comparable properties in biden 's neighborhood and found three cases three cases where homes went for below asking price however nobody actually bothered to negotiate it appears that mbna indirectly helped cochrane buy the biden house through six figure executive compensation funds listed as moving expenses and losses suffered on the sale of his previous home again this is just all inside the beltway garbage corrupt politics and as we all know for a long time now biden 's family 's been cashing in on his career for decades ryan grimm writing for the intercept which is not a right - wing source he says the problem for democrats is that a review of hunter biden 's career clearly shows that he along with joe biden 's brother james has been trading on their family name for decades cashing in on the implication and sometimes the explicit argument that giving money to a member of joe biden 's family wins the favor of joe biden democrats have been loathed to give any credibility to wild groundings of trump or rudy giuliani leaving them to sidestep the question of hunter biden 's ethics or decision - making and how much responsibility joe biden deserves investigative reporters and gop operatives have dived deep into the question of whether joe biden ever used his official power to do favors for special interests shoveling money to his family they found no exact proof of this but that does not mean the biden 's behavior is not a legitimate problem for democrats indeed biden has been taking political hits over the intersection of his family 's financial dealings and his own political career for some four decades if he has done nothing publicly to inoculate himself from the charge his career is corruptly enriching his family and now that is a serious liability hey in 2006 bo biden who died of cancer in 2015 was roped into an investment meeting led by james and hunter biden at the firm paradigm global advisors the family was considering acquiring the firm james biden told executives he 'd have no problem bringing in people looking for an in with joe biden who was u.s senator at the time we have got people all over the world who want to invest in joe biden james biden told officials with the firm beau biden turned red in the face he told his uncle this can never leave this room if you ever say it again i will have nothing to do with this hunter and james denied the account to politico the magazine stood by it we have got investors lined up and we have got investors lined up in a line of 747s filled with cash ready to invest in this company a paradigm executive recalls james biden saying in 2014 a stepson of the former secretary of state john kerry chris heinz gave hunter a similar warning that pair were partners in an investment firm rose monsenica when hunter biden and a third partner devon archer were invited to were invited to join the board of burisma heinz told the washington post he strongly objected to hunter biden and archer taking the board seats obama administration officials were concerned as well in april 2014 of course hunter went ahead and accepted the invitation to join the board along with a fee of at least fifty thousand dollars a month,0.7891,"when it comes to israel 's current war against hamas there is a clear gap between the sides on a moral level one side hamas and its allies seeks to murder civilians that 's why they slaughtered 1,400 innocent jews in israel and have planted their military sites directly in civilian areas while attempting to stop their own civilians from escaping those areas kamas openly acknowledges they say that they use civilians as human shields the other side israel seeks to save civilians that 's precisely why hamas locates its military assets in civilian neighborhoods if israel were truly a human right monster that do not care about civilians kamas would have no incentive to shield its weapons with innocent gins on the one side hamas has a health ministry that routinely lies in 2014 for example hamas 's interior ministry website issued instructions to online activists including the following statements these are direct quotes quote anyone killed or martyred is to be called a civilian from gaza or palestine before we talk about his status in jihad or his military rank do not forget to always add innocent civilian or innocent citizen in your description of those killed in israeli att attacks on gaza they also say quote avoid publishing pictures of rockets fired into israel from gaza city centers this would provide a pretext for attacking residential areas in the gaza strip unquote because hamas runs a tyrannical terror estate media members are routinely told what to report which is why that same year in 2014 the washington post admitted that when it comes to body counts the hamas health minister was quote the only game in town they threaten reporters that same minister acknowledged that he maximized the count of civilian casualties the new york times in 2014 recognized that hamas atates such statistics as well the other side israel is a democracy with high levels of transparency a free press a robust democracy with highly aggressive opposition parties the current prime minister of israel has been dragged by that media and opposition through scandal after scandal that does not mean that israel does not get things wrong it does mean that israel does not make lying its central principle in military matters one side hamas and its esteemed colleagues in palestinian islamic jihad has a very long history of firing rockets that end up hitting their own people in 2022 for example israel estimated that some 1/5th of all 1,000 palestinian islamic jihad rockets fell within gaza during the current war over 7,000 rockets have been fired at israel at least 400 of them fell short and hit gaza here are just some video examples from the recent past on october 17th islamic jihad destroyed a hospital in gaza when a rocket aimed toward israel misfired and landed in gaza this is not the first time while thousands of rockets are fired toward israel rockets fail these failed rocket launches cause mass destruction and the death of countless innocent individuals inside gaza now here 's a map of all the failed launches during this war alone you can see this map blankets the entire gaza strip from south to north one side israel has a precision military that seeks to hit as many military targets in as efficient a way as possible that military routinely passes up shots on military targets if too many civilians will be harmed so with all of this said naturally when a hospital allegedly blew up in the gaza strip yesterday afternoon and hamas immediately claimed that the explosion was an israeli air strike and that 500 people had been k killed the media used their heads they decided to wait for all the information to emerge because you know hamas are liars nah just kidding they went with hamas 's report because this is what they do as it turned out hamas was as usual lying lying from beginning to end a failed palestinian islamic jihad rocket hit the hospital actually to be more accurate it hit the parking lot next to the hospital doing no apparent structural damage to the building we still do not know how many people actually died we do not know the real number of casualties it took israel weeks to determine how many people had died in the assault on its southern border hamas throughout the number 500 within 15 minutes of the rocket falling there 's only one reason the media jumped to listen to hamas the media have an insanely strong stake in creating moral equivalence between israel and its terrorist opponents they operate under a soft - headed mindset that seeks moral parity between parties to a conflict but as it turns out they only seek that moral parity when one of the parties is jews if we are talking about say russia ukraine the american media treat every russian claim with a grain of salt and believe pretty much everything put out by the ukrainian government if we are talking about a full - on terrorist group that just slaughtered babies however our media are suddenly shockingly credulous they suddenly believe what the terrorists have to say how interesting how revealing well we are actually watching in real time as a genocidal jew hating terror group launder a lie about a jewish massacre of innocence at a baptist hospital is what we call a blood lial that term dates back to the year 1144 when jew haters charged the jews of norwich england with ritually murdering a young boy named william for religious purposes frequently such blood lials claim that jews used christian blood to bake passover matah similar blood liels were used for centuries all the way through the time of the nazis they are still repeated very frequently in arabic language media in the middle east the goal is obvious to turn the jews into monsters and thus to justify their murder blood lials historically have led to pums to expulsions to genocide targeted against jews blood liels end in actual blood now the same is true right here kamas retailed a blood liel this is a blood liel and the media credulously picked it up their sudden credulity has consequences very deep consequences people are going to die because the media bit hamas 's hook here but again that 's really nothing new legacy media hatred for the state of israel is decades old really dating back to the post 67 era and has cost thousands of lives on all sides if the west had taken seriously hamas 's own words or for that matter the words of the palestinian authority and islamic jihad israel never would have been forced into dangerous concessions to terrorist groups that have ended with thousands of deaths but the media continue to pretend that moral equivalence is the story in the middle east it 's a comforting easy story they lie or at the very least they pretend that israel 's enemies have serious credibility those lies cost blood",1.4818,but it it will definitely be big and popular if women supported other women who you think hating on women have you

republicans are still expected to lose the house majority but retain the senate the issue is the polls were wrong in 2016 when it came to donald trump and i can not imagine that these polling companies have updated their methodology to correct it for the mistakes they made in 2016 the predictions were wrong the polls were wrong however early voting data suggests republicans may be losing their edge a couple weeks ago we heard that an early and absentee voting republicans had a huge lead but according to the latest data it looks like their percentage lead over the democrats compared to the last midterm is actually much much lower so perhaps all of the rhetoric on all of the media has really riled people up to get out and vote and that 's why we are seeing a record early voting turnout however young people are turning out in massive numbers and this could be bad news for republicans because young people tend to vote democrat so today let us take a look at all of the relevant data and ask the question are the polls wrong again or are the polls being proven right by the latest data but before we get started please head over to patreon comm /team cast to help support my work patrons are the backbone of the content i create so if you are a fan of these videos and you want to see more and head over to patreon.com forward slash tim cast to become a patron today from the hill young and new voters surged in early voting hundreds of thousands of new voters are showing up to cast their ballots early in the weeks before the midterm elections fueling democratic hopes that a younger electorate may help them over the finish line in key states the number of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who have cast ballots early has surpassed turnout levels from the last midterm election in just about every state according to several sources tracking early vote totals the youth vote is higher than 2014 so far but so few young people have voted at this point it is not hard to double the numbers said michael mcdonald a university of florida political scientist who tracks early voting totals young people tend to vote in larger numbers during the week prior to the election and we are seeing some evidence that young people are indeed starting to turn out they say that according to a harvard poll younger voters favored democrats over republicans in the battle for congress by a 66 % to 32 percent margin and similar data is found when we go to pew internet research millennial men 49 % are democrat 41 % are republican and among millennial women the gap is even more staggering 70 % of millennial women identify as democrat and only 23 % identified as republican which means if the early voting numbers are accurate the democrats have a huge advantage as of right now even though republicans are outpacing them in terms of early voting the interesting point to make out is that according to that other article from the hill young people are turning out for early voting but it 's not hard to double those numbers because they do not come out very often as it is will we see a massive voter turnout for the actual day of the election well here 's my prediction if we are seeing early voter turnout for young people then we will probably see the same thing on election day however according to one poll in the hill only four in 10 young voters say they will definitely vote 40 percent of young americans said they will definitely vote in this year 's midterm elections which if true would be more than the number who voted in the last two midterms according to a poll released monday they add it remains to be seen if voter interest among young americans will translate to voter turnout the harvard poll noted that midterm turnout among young americans has surpassed 20 percent just twice since 1986 so here we have early voting data from a group called target smart and full disclosure target smart appears to be a democratic data analytics company so perhaps they favor the democrats in terms of how they break things down just keep that in mind but we are going to look at their data because i believe their data does come from each state 's early voter data but real quick let us take a look at the current polls according to real clear politics the aggregate shows democrats are expected to take 202 seats republicans 196 seats but 37 are toss - ups they could really go either way now according to their data the republicans are facing a larger risk than democrats are there are many more seats that are considered toss - ups towards republicans than democrats so if the data from target smart is accurate it looks like the democrats might take a huge lead when it comes to young people as of right now we can see right here that the gop as modeled by target smart has an advantage of around 400,000 votes in early voting what 's interesting is that when you come haier those numbers to 2014 where the total is 22 we can see based on all of this data down here that the percentage the gop leads of the democrats is actually much lower when you combine the totals of the modeled democrats versus gop they had close to a 10 percent lead in 2014 but only around a 2.5 percent lead as of right now that 's an important point because republicans are typically ahead of democrats in early and absentee voting that was true in 2014 the democrats get a bigger push when it comes to in - person voting if their lead has strung this much it looks like democrats are starting to encroach on the edge the republican said this could be bad news for republicans but what 's really interesting the increase in voter turnout among young people favors democrats and it 's a pretty massive turnout in 2014 the model dems was 559 thousand its 1.1 million votes higher as of the same time it 's 1.1 million votes higher among 30 to 39 and it 's about a million votes higher among 40 to 49 the republicans only made a gain of about 500,000 from 18 to 29 30 to 39 and just shy of a million when it comes to 40 to 49 it 's the 50 to 64 and 65 plus demographics that lean in favor of the republicans but only by about 20 % each here 's the bad news for republicans early voter turnout tends to favor republicans democrats are favored when it comes to in - person voting that means if this data is a reflection of who is going to turnout and the democrats are seeing a two - to - one advantage in early voting among young people young people might actually turn out in large numbers and have a huge impact on the midterms but there are other important factors to take in first of all most of the early voting has come from white people and this makes sense considering white people are the majority of the country but they are the only demographic to lean in favor of the republicans african american asian hispanic other and uncoated all leaned towards the democrats and even among gender men lean republican women lean democrat this is exactly what we expected based on the data men tend to be republican according to the pew research a lot of people are saying the midterms are a referendum on donald trump the midterms tend to be a referendum on the current job of the president 's i do not think that 's a true i think this is all about the culture war most people who do not like donald trump do not like him for cultural reasons when you talk to people it 's because he 's racist or his rhetoric is bad or he encourages violence they are not really talking about his policy for the most part and a lot of the policies they do criticize have been in place for a really long time when it comes to foreign policy and drone bombing that all existed before trump when it comes to the border and family separation it existed before trump now trump is definitely stronger on immigration and the ideas towards immigration among democrats are changing so that may be a factor but for the most part i think what we are seeing when it comes to race and gender is that this really is about identity politics and the culture war why is it that among millennials white men tend to be much more in favor of republicans than millennial women although millennial men are more likely be democrats i think the answer is simple you constantly hear rhetoric from the mainstream left talking about white men and white privilege and these ideas that can threaten or insult young white men and when they push the idea that white people have an inherent advantage over other people they kind of misconstrue what 's actually going on you can not make the argument that a minority millionaire has less privileged than a homeless white person they seem to misunderstand the ideas of class and thus we end up seeing wealthy progressives and celebrities who tend to be white talking down to working - class whites and one of the reasons donald trump carried states he probably should not have is because hillary clinton was not communicating with the working class of this country and it is widely believed among a lot of people that working - class whites were abandoned by the democrats now here 's something i find really interesting about the young people who are turning out to vote for trump what i see when it comes to this internet culture of memeing and funny jokes",0.506,prevail identity is instead the result of continual and iterated communication cooperation and competition between parents and children husbands and wives friends colleagues subordinates superiors and the present and future selves of sovereign individuals identity is therefore and must remain a carefully and justly negotiated agreement between the individual and society at every level of that society conservatives can therefore offer a revitalized conception of sovereign citizenship as the most meaningful and significant form of identity the sovereign citizenship that makes each person a credit to themselves a reliable partner in marriage a caring judicious and discriminating parent a trustworthy and competent partner in enterprise an active participant in local and distal civic institutions and an informed enlightened and ethical political actor and voter this is all predicated upon conceptualizing and articulating the need for a shift in the western individual 's moral outlook away from the narrowly hedonistic blandishments of endless rights and externally bestowed privileges and toward the constructive rewards attendant upon a mature sacrifice duty responsibility and reciprocity merit individuals vary widely in their abilities across the entire range of human endeavor a small number of highly productive people operating within all domains of human creative endeavor account for most of the production and progress a direct relationship therefore obtains between the recognition and promotion of excellence and the ability for societies to ameliorate absolute privation to generate and disseminate creative solutions to new and unexpected problems to provide opportunity for individual and social flourishing and advancement and to justly and effectively reward those endeavoring to be productive successful and generous the tight causal connection between merit and consequence means that pure merit can be defined objectively by the ability to undertake the work and build the social networks associated with goals valued by the free choice of actors in the free marketplaces of friendship community association consumer choice employment opportunity and political decision such merit has been validly however partially and imperfectly and must remain the fundamental principle governing selection placement and advancement in our social institutions responsibility every individual requires a purpose to offset the tragedy of life every person needs something of true value to set against the anxiety frustration disappointment grief and pain of mortal existence that purpose is not to be found in the cynicism that too easily replaces an initial naivety or in a short - sighted narrow and reactive hedonism but in the establishment of the stable reliable truthful and productive intimate relationships friendships apprenticeships civic bonds political duties philosophical commitments and religious habits and practices in the absence of the structure and direction produced by such bonds and activities the tragedy of life looms unacceptably large individuals subjected to suffering in the absence of an orientation towards meaning and responsibility becomes cynical unstable hopeless and alienated then resentful vengeful and dangerous conservatives can offer personal responsibility the committed social bonds of marriage family and job and true civic engagement as valid and reliable antidotes to the nihilism of unearned cynicism the temptation of narrow short - term pleasure and the demoralizing consequences of faithless hopelessness such advocates can remind us all that sacrifice the willingness to forestall the gratifications of the immediate moment the willingness to engage in difficult endeavors in the present to build something worthwhile for the future the moral obligation to withstand the trials of immediate timely disagreement and conflict to ensure a lasting peace is a laudable necessary and ultimately redeeming activity such advocates can finally define a pathway through the pitfalls of guilt offering atonement through responsibility as the proper response to the inevitably unequal distribution of talents and privileges community the west has rightly emphasized the value of the individual drawing on traditions derived from rome athens and jerusalem the admirably liberal west has properly and usefully articulated a doctrine of individual rights grounded in natural law in consequence and that has led to an era of freedom unparalleled in its productivity generosity and universality but the highest ideal to which an individual might aspire can not be grounded in an atomistic individualism or predicated on the assumption that the highest manifestation of human striving be akin to an isolated self - actualization conservatives can rightly insist the highest must serve the lowest communally in the truly religious sense can rightly observe that we find our very sanity in relationship to community conservatives can note that sanity itself both personal and social is something continually and inescapably negotiated that there can simply not be the happiness or the pursuit thereof at the individual level in the absence of the optimally functioning social surround a purely individual ethos is shallow unsustainable unworthy and fragile what do we do when our happiness vanishes a purely individual ethos fails to provide the orientation crucial for the upward striving that constitutes hope the integrity necessary to resist temptation the antidote to the dangerous and narcissistic expansion of ego and presumption or the bounds of love that support us through tribulation trial and tragedy [ music ] stewardship those who uphold the conservative ethos can offer responsible stewardship as the appropriate response to the necessity of maintaining harmony in our relationship with the natural world upon which our lives ultimately depend this is an extension of the proper canonical response to the treasures of the historical past that which is valuable should be recognized valued maintained guarded and passed on down the generational chain the scope of human activities has expanded in recent decades to a scale that makes of those activities a genuine planetary force this presents us with real dangers as well as unparalleled opportunities panicked apocalyptic thinking in relation to the former demoralizes invites a careless and self - serving demonization and derogation and justifies the kind of impulsive in cautious reactive global response that can easily produce unforeseen problems of the same magnitude or greater than the original problem thoughtful stewards of the natural world governed by the doctrines intrinsic to the western canon can as an alternative recognize the particulars of the problems characterizing the relationship between our industrial culture and the natural world can confidently note the fact that the human ingenuity most effectively manifested in free societies has and might endlessly and ever more efficiently continue to ameliorate poverty and rectify excessive inequality can encourage conceptualization of the human population and its constituent individuals as a net good in the planetary context can deliver to young people first and foremost the message that people of faith courage and good will can manage the very real problems that confront us and make the future not the apocalypse that is always threatening but the eternally productive and abundant garden that we may all tend and inhabit justice every individual who strives upward in the optimal and socially beneficial manner deserves and must be granted the benefits attendant upon the consequences of that striving this is the judicious and discerning recognition rewarding and reinforcement of productive and generous ability this is the justice that fosters and maintains that productive generosity at the individual and the social level this is the justice that applies discriminating attention to the endeavors and utterances of past and present and enables constant separation of wheat from chaff this is the justice that has in the past and must continue to be in the future the irreplaceable necessary and corrective compliment to what would otherwise be the in cautious too forgiving and infantilizing universal compassion that too easily masquerades and demands recognition as moral virtue itself conservatives can rightly insist it is this true and comprehensive justice grounded in the irreplaceable traditions of our forebears that has been and must continue to be both available and applied equally to all citizens regardless of birth or circumstances tradition conservatives must state with courageous faith and confidence the fundamental institutions of the west are solid philosophically and practically the idea that each individual is equal before the law and of divine intrinsic worth is inextricably associated with the presumption of the sovereign citizen as well as the associated insistence that the stability of the state rests upon the careful and truthful judgment of that citizen the idea that honest and untrammeled discourse among men and women of goodwill constitutes the eternal pathway to the truth that refreshes and redeems is a realization whose profundity of conceptualization and reliability and application is unparalleled in human history the parliaments congresses and senates where those of us in the west transform the inarticulate but reliable and trustworthy sentiments and desires of the people into the articulated body of laws we all abide by are fundamentally good and functional but require the wise trust and act of engagement that conservatives would do well to embody and promote marriage not sexual satisfaction is the most appropriate goal for love children and adults flourish in stable two - parent families the broader community is best served by stable marriage and family the needs of those in absolute poverty are best served by an uncorrupted and genuinely cooperative and competitive free market economy the very real problem of inequality is best solved by a commendable combination of productivity and generosity within the framework that such structured systems provide all of this nests within the overarching framework of the abrahamic canon bequeathed to us by our forebears and should be presented in a spirit of gratitude and humility as an inextricable part and parcel of that inheritance unity a house divided against itself can not stand respect for individual sovereignty appreciation for the intact family responsible engagement in civic institutions gratitude for the traditions that bind us and protect us from chaos and courageous trust in the essential good will of others means unity in both appearance and reality conservatives at their best are characterized by profound appreciation for the necessity of such unity apprehending it properly as the basis for the peaceful cooperation and competition that made makes and keeps us strong in the face of both adversity and enmity such unity also provides for the psychological and social predictability and structure that keeps the destabilizing terror of uncertainty at bay as well as for the shared communal purpose that provides the very framework for individual hope the notion that no such unity is possible or that it is always purchased through the use of self - interested power and compulsion means only in the first case that disunity and the chaos that accompanies it is inevitable and in the second that a profound misunderstanding is in place regarding the causal relationship between true stability and productive peace and the principles of free choice voluntary association reciprocal exchange mature capacity to forestall gratification and responsible action the acceptance of these twin presumptions dooms their holder to a counterproductive and destabilizing anxiety and aimless hopelessness and a consequent bitter cynicism and with no conceptual or practical alternative to the personal wielding of arbitrary force this is a recipe for personal doom and social catastrophe conclusion the blind and instrumental insistence the truth is an illusion and that nothing but power truly rules has left virtually everything of true and enduring use as a guide to purpose and a bulwark against despair abandoned on the wayside the demoralized people of the west and indeed in the rest of the world are therefore crying out for the restoration of the abdicated values of individual sovereignty and responsible genuine social service and purpose whose acceptance and embodiment make our free societies possible productive admirable generative and stable conservatives who abide by the dictates of the eternal western canon have the opportunity beckoning in front of them to once again make the case that the principles upon which we operate the virtues in which we believe and the freedom we have been divinely granted truly and eternally constitute the basis for the life more abundant which people of good faith desire and which we have every ability to establish and maintain thank you all for watching and listening i genuinely hope that you find the vision that is beginning to be elaborated in this document compelling and engaging i am going to add to it two appendices which i will tape separately we will call them a conservative manifesto colon appendices which detail out two additional topics one related to poverty and inequality and their nature and amelioration and the second dealing with the precise nature of the relationship between personal responsibility and meaningful engagement and so if you appreciated this first manifesto then give some consideration to also attending to the appendices thanks again for your time and attention,0.3627,so i could so we can connect on the instagram uh napolitan apologetic apologist the trinity separates jesus from god and also seeks to weaken god by dividing him invited his power into three there is no separation jesus is god in the flesh he had the mind of man but the spirit of god now let me clarify it because i agree ninety - nine percent of what you say the trinity is not even close like you are going to see three persons you your worship and three gods it does not matter how many times you say you are not you three guys because i am just going to explain it to you it 's very simple if jesus is god the father is god and the spirit is god and they are three separate persons right they have three separate wheels because jesus said not my will but thy will o lord not my words but the words of the father that 's in me he said father why have that forsaken me jesus was forsook by the father jesus never said anything that was his words only the father 's words that was in him jesus do not have his own spirit he has the spirit of the father in him now you tell me if god can die so jesus died on the cross i can not do my fingers like this because my finger messed up i may have used some different fingers these three jesus died i am going to use the jesus i do not either put my middle finger up jesus died on the cross so the god died did a part of god died or was it all made up the bible does not say the flesh died the bible do not say a part of jesus died bible do not say his spirit died it said jesus was dead now if you did it you have to be resurrected right if jesus why did he need to be resurrected if the flesh died and there was the end of it now if jesus is dead and he had to be resurrected who resurrected jesus the father like who resurrected jesus,0.5664,a new poll from emerson shows that not only is bernie sanders the frontrunner for the democratic primary but it also shows that around 20 % of his supporters would rather vote for donald trump if bernie sanders is not chosen as the nominee it would seem bernie or bust is back with a vengeance because back in 2016 it was reported around 12 % of bernie 's supporters decided to vote for donald trump and this report actually offended many people who are on the far left and who supported bernie sanders the insinuation that they had anything in common with donald trump is rather offensive and this is highlighted recently by comments made by peabody gentian but in reality what people on the left and the right might not realize that they are independent voters that are more concerned with our manufacturing based jobs and immigration and left or right is not as important as these core issues bernie sanders and donald trump were both very strong on his issues in fact at a rally bernie sanders recently said donald trump is not going far enough to protect american jobs from the north american free trade agreement today let us take a look at the latest polls and the reports that show bernie sanders voters may flip for donald trump and secure him a 2020 victory but before we get started make sure you are following me over on minds at minds.com slash tim cast i am hoping to break a hundred thousand subscribers and i need your support to do it but more importantly we are using these big tech oligopoly censorious platforms so it 's very very important you guys follow me somewhere where i am substantially less likely to be censored and that 's over at minds.com slash tim cast now if you want to support this video just share it on social media help spread the news our first story from tellus or 20 % bernie supporters will not vote for dems if he loses the primary now it 's important to point out that telus or is partially funded by the venezuelan government but i am using the source specifically to highlight concerns of the far left over the thought that bernie supporters might actually support trump instead the story says a new emerson poll discovered that almost 20 % of supporters of second time presidential candidate senator bernie sanders would vote for the united states president donald trump during the 2020 presidential election if sanders does not win the prime the poll also showed that sanders is ahead of former vice president joe biden who has been accused of harassment by multiple women almost 29 percent of respondents want bernie to win and 24 percent want biden if south bend mayor pete bootie judge won the primary 21 percent of sanders supporters would vote for trump whereas 26 percent said they would do the same if elizabeth warren wins 18 percent of beta or work wins and 17 percent said the same would happen if kamala harris wins the primary on the contrary all of buddha judges supporters said they would vote for sanders if he won the primary almost all of warren 's 94 % harris 's 98 % and o'rourke 's 91 percent supporters said the same thing of all the supporters of the top democratic candidates buddha judges gave trump the lowest approval rating at 0 % many of the supporters ie 43 % are also most likely to identify as independents bernie or bust was not about supporting trump for the most part it was either bernie or bust if bernie sanders is not the nominee in 2016 people said they just would not vote but it was reported around 12 percent of voters who supported bernie decided to vote for donald trump,0.9226,even his former employer the washington post although he did defend the paper saying the publisher catherine graham at the time and managing editors were unaware of the operation and claimed only stringers were involved was he protecting his former employer or treating the invest investigation into them with kid gloves while that 's likely the case it 's also possible that he was just in denial about their involvement but his rolling stone story was still packed with information not mentioned at all during the church hearing bernstein wrote quote journalists provided a full range of clandestine services from simple intelligence gathering to serving as go - betweens with spies in communist countries reporters shared their notebooks with the cia editors shared their staffs cia documents show journalists were engaged to perform tasks for the cia with the consent of the managements of america 's leading news organizations he pointed out that part of the operation included using journalists to quote aid in the recruitment and handling of foreign nationals who are channels of secret information reaching american intelligence he continued quote many journalists were used by the cia to assist in this process and they had the repute rotation of being among the best in the business the peculiar nature of the job of a foreign correspondent is ideal for such work he is accustomed to unusual access by his host country permitted to travel in areas often off limits to other americans spends much of his time cultivating sources in governments academic institutions the military establishments and scientific communities he has the opportunity to form long - term personal relationships with sources and perhaps more than any other category of american operative is in a position to make correct judgments about the susceptibility and availability of foreign nationals for recruitments as spies he goes on quote the tasks they performed sometimes consisted of little more than serving as eyes and ears for the cia reporting on what they had seen or overheard in an eastern european factory on other occasions their assignments were more complex planting subtly concocted pieces of misinformation hosting parties or receptions designed to bring together american agents and foreign spies serving up black propaganda to leading foreign journalists at lunch or dinner providing their hotel rooms or bureau offices as drops for highly sensitive information moving to and from foreign agents conveying instructions and dollars to the cia controlled members of foreign governments do you understand what he just said there international correspondents are literally used to give cash bribes to foreign officials bernstein even explained how unsuspecting journalists were recruited for the program quote often the cia 's relationship with a journalist might begin informally with a lunch a drink a casual exchange of information an agency official might then offer a favor for example a trip to a country difficult to reach in return he would seek nothing more than the opportunity to debrief the reporter afterwards a few more lunches a few more favors and only then might there be a mention of a formal arrangement that came later said a cia official after you had the journalist on a string could this explain lane how the washington post and the new york times keep getting classified information leaked to them in order to damage the trump administration are they willing servants of the deep state trying to bring down the president by any means necessary senator chuck schumer once gave an ominous warning to president trump when he said that the intelligence agencies have six ways from sunday to get back at you if they do not like what you are doing bernstein quotes one cia official as admitting in return for our giving them information we 'd ask them to do things that fit their roles as journalists but that they would not have thought of unless we put it in their minds this was all informal and unofficial the formal recruitment of reporters bernstein says only occurred after they had been vetted with background checks to ensure they could be trusted as quote agents of the government journalists being considered had to sign non - disclosure agreements before the offer was even made aid and bernstein quotes an unnamed former assistant to the cia director as saying quote the secrecy agreement was the sort of ritual that got you into the tabernacle and quote david atlee phillips a former cia chief operations officer himself admitted that more than 200 journalists had signed non - disclosure agreements with the cia which bernstein described as making up a good old boy network that constituted something of an establishment elite in the media politics in academia who wrote quote propaganda for cia proprietary publications once uncovered by the church committee the cia tried to paint operation mockingbird as something that only functioned to influence foreign press but carl bernstein admits quote the cia 's use of the american news media has been much more extensive than agency officials have acknowledged publicly or in closed sessions with members of congress he goes so far as to say a quote the use of journalists has been among the most productive means of intelligence gathering employed by the cia cia director william colby admitted during the church hearing that people in management were involved not just reporters and they helped the cia with the program and while colby would not name names carl bernstein pointed to william paley who was the president of cbs henry lewis the founder of time magazine and arthur hayes slossberger the publisher of the new york times who actually admitted the cia had him sign a non - disclosure agreement at least 10 employees at the new york times were working as cia assets or were actually cia agents who the paper were providing cover for often in their foreign press bureau the cia even had a training program in the 1950s which taught agents how to pretend to be journalists and were sometimes placed in major news organizations with help from management it was not just newspapers of course the big three television networks nbc cbs and abc at the time were involved as well cbs provided journalistic cover for cia employees and allowed their newsrooms to be monitored by the cia bernstein says that in the 1950s and 60s cbs officials even met for an annual dinner with the cia sid mickelson later admitted that when he became the president of cbs quote i was told by paley the cia director that there was an ongoing relationship with the cia he introduced me to two agents who he said would keep in touch we all discussed the goodrich situation one of the undercover agents and film arrangements i assumed this was a normal relationship at the time this was at the height of the cold war and i assume the communications media were cooperating though the good good rich matter was compromising high level cia officials worked with quote top management of the news agencies to give agents working undercover as journalists assignments in foreign countries according to bernstein and the cia had some of the best known correspondents in the business as operatives using tv networks for journalists to cover he also noted that a reporter is the perfect cover for a cia operator because it 's a reporter 's job to ask questions investigate things and travel around the world to do so colby admitted that the agency had quote some three dozen american reporters editors or executives on the cia payroll including five who worked for the general circulation news organizations william bader who supervised the senate committee 's investigation admitted that there were cia officers at management levels in major media companies malcolmir newsweek 's former editor said quote whatever i heard something that i thought might be of interest to alan dulles i 'd call him up at one point he appointed one of his cia men to keep in regular contact with our reporters during the church hearings then cia director william colby tried to claim they were not doing any of this anymore and dumb played the program saying it do not work as well as they had hoped but he was just whitewashing its effectiveness and many said that even the church hearing itself was part of the cover - up for example they do not even question any of the journalists or executives who were working for the cia why would not they want to get major media executives and reporters on the witness stand to testify under oath about what they were doing this should have been a key part of the investigation but it was not why because they do not want to dig that deep they do not want the extent of the program and who was involved to be known the committee was compromised and limited their investigation to prevent the magnitude of what was happening from being made public carl bernstein wrote that the cia were able to convince key members of the committee that full inquiry or even limited public disclosure of the dimensions of the activity would do irreparable damage to the nation 's intelligence gathering apparatus as well as to the reputations of hundreds of individuals at the time of the senate investigation george bush senior was the director of the cia and pressured members of the committee and successfully persuaded them to essentially whitewash the investigation the cia refused to turn over documents about which journalists were working for them and only gave the committee rewritten summaries of documents all of which had the names of journalists and media executives removed most of the documents they did turn over were about foreign journalists on foreign soil giving the false impression that such a thing was not happening in america speaking of the church committee 's final report senator gary hart said quote it hardly reflects what we found there was a prolonged and elaborate negotiation with the cia over what would be said in other words it was a whitewash just another limited hangout with some damning information but as usual the full truth would remain hidden most people are completely unaware of the church committee today and if they were told about operation mockingbird would just think it 's a conspiracy theory but as one unnamed senator quoted in carl bernstein 's rolling stone story says from the cia point of view this was the highest most sensitive covert program of all it was a much larger part of the operational system than has been indicated see what i mean see why i have been telling you

amendments these amendments originally applied only to the federal government this court has held the due process clause of the 14th amendment incorporates the great majority of those rights and thus makes them equally applicable to the state well you will notice when you look at the constitution is that the first amendment for example says congress shall make noah abridging freedom of speech now as you can imagine when it says congress shall make no law a bridging freedom of this speech it does not apply to states or local governments congress is a specific term meaning a specific body that makes law at the federal level the supreme court spent a couple of hundred years incorporating the first amendment rights into state law what they said is that the 14th amendment passed after the civil war meant to take federal rights and then jam them down on the states so the federal government could step in and enforce them on the state which is not true but the supreme court has been doing that for a long time says justice alito the second category which is the one in question here comprises a select list of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the constitution in deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories the court has long asked whether the right is quote deeply rooted in our history and tradition and whether it is essential to our nation 's scheme of ordered liberty historical inquiries of this nature are essential whenever we are asked to recognize a new components of the liberty protected by the due process clause because of the term liberty alone provides little guidance liberty is a capacious term as lincoln once said well we all declare for liberty but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing in a well - known essay isaiah berlin reported that historians of ideas had cataloged more than 200 different senses in which the terms had been used and interpreting what is meant by the 14th amendment 's reference to liberty we must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what that amendment protects with our own ardent views about the liberty that americans should enjoy that is why the court has long been reluctant to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the constitution in other words even if you are going to say that the 14th amendment due process clause means that certain liberties guaranteed at the federal level must also be guaranteed at the state level that generally is restricted to the liberties explicitly mentioned in the constitution if you are going to simply say whatever liberty you please is now in the constitution because you want it to be there and then jam it down at the state level via the due process clause you are not supposed to do that according to justice alito quote substantivity process has at times been a treacherous field for this court that is a quote from a case called moore versus east cleveland 1977 and it sometimes led the court to usurp authority the constitution trusts to the people elected representatives as the court cautioned in glucksburg quote we must exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field lest the liberty protected by the new process clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the members of this court on occasion when the court has ignored the appropriate limits imposed by respect for the teachings of history it has fallen into the freewheeling judicial policy making that characterized discredited decisions such as lochner versus new york the court must not fall prey to such an unprincipled approach instead guided by the history and tradition that mapped the essential components of our nation 's concept of order of liberty we must ask what the 14th amendment meant by the term liberty when we engage in that inquiry in the present case the clear answer is the 14th amendment does not protect the right to an abortion so in other words even if you are going to claim that liberty is not mentioned in the constitution are guaranteed by the 14th amendment there is no basis historically speaking for suggesting that such liberties encompass abortion says alito until the latter part of the 20th century there was no support in american law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion zero none no state constitutional provision had recognized such a right until a few years before roe was handed down at no federal or state court had recognized such a right nor had any scholarly treatise of which we are aware and although law review articles are not reticent about advocating new rights the earliest article proposing a constitutional right to abortion that has come to our attention was published just a few years before roe there 's an article in like the north carolina law review in 1968 not only was there no support for such a constitutional right until shortly before roe abortion had long been a crime in every single state a common law abortion was regarded as unlawful and could have been very serious consequences at all stages american law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions by the time of the adoption of the 14th amendment three quarters of the state have made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy the remaining states would soon follow so if you are going to argue the 14th amendment protects abortion you are going to have to explain why every single state had laws criminalizing abortion at the time of the 14th amendment roe either ignored or misstated this history casey declined to reconsider rose faulty historical analysis it is important therefore to set the record straight and then alito goes into a very long disquisition on the history of abortion law in the united states and he says in some although common law authorities differed on the severity of punishment for abortions committed at different points in pregnancy none endorsed the practice moreover we are aware of no common law case or authority and the parties have not pointed to any that remotely suggests a positive right to procure an abortion at any stage of pregnancy in other words the argument made by roe that there is a right to obtain an abortion no one makes that argument and there were some states in which abortion was more legal than others but nobody argued you had an actual right to abortion no one historically speaking,1.0964,they are banning the entry of russian planes into eu airspace they are banning from the 27 country block russian state - owned media outlets russia today and sputnik as well as their subsidiaries ms van der layne said the eu 's decision to finance arms purchases was a watershed moment the eu traces its roots to the post - world war ii peace efforts and began as an economic alliance so the eu is now effectively rearming they are saying that we are not going to take this sitting down nor are we going to hold ourselves subject to the predation of the russian government the european union has also you remember that time that donald trump said that nato should increase all the nato countries should increase their amount of spending percentage of their gdp on defense and everybody got very angry at him for saying all this well all it took was vladimir putin invading ukraine for that to happen according to the wall street journal germany is now going to boost its own military spending about two percent of gdp and create a strategic natural gas reserve they are actually taking this seriously so after decades of shutting down their own ability to power their economy via carbon - based fuels they have decided that they are going to re - up on that they are going to stop with all of this let us spend billions and billions of dollars on green tech and make ourselves more dependent on russian natural gas and oil instead they are going to create their own strategic natural gas reserve and essentially rearm according to the wall street journal the measures all of which had long been resisted by successive governments and will now be reflected in this year 's budget underline how profoundly russia 's attack on ukraine is upending european politics after almost eight decades of nearly uninterrupted peace on the continent olaf scholes said we have to ask ourselves what capacities does putin 's russia have which capacities do we need to counter his threats it 's clear we need to invest a lot more in the security of our country to defend our freedom and our democracy putin wants to establish a russian empire the question is whether we can summon the strength to set boundaries to war mongers like putin for decades germany had managed to reconcile rising welfare expenditure with budget surpluses by constraining investments in defense and other areas hollowing out its armed forces also the country has resisted diversifying its energy resources relying instead on plentiful russian gas supplied through the controversial nordstrom undersea pipeline running between the two countries germany has more than half of its gas coming from russia scholes said he would immediately invest the equivalent of 100 billion euros in weaponry starting now he said germany 's military spending would exceed the nato organization spending target of two percent of gdp he also said the government will create strategic gas reserves and finance the building of two liquefied natural gas import terminals on the country 's northern coast so finally the europeans are actually getting serious about what it is they are doing at this point ukraine for its part is saying we would like to join the eu formally so all of the things that vladimir putin was seeking to prevent here namely ukraine joining the eu formally he has now essentially forced the hand which by the way means that he is going to have to go through full scale with the invasion there 's not going to be a peace agreement here short of zolensky essentially surrendering himself to putin which he 's not going to do according to cnn ukrainian president vladimir zelinsky asked the european union on monday to urgently admit ukraine to the bloc he said in his latest video message we appeal to the european union to urgently admit ukraine using a new procedure we are grateful to partners for standing with us our goal is to be with all europeans and to be equal to them i am sure we deserve it i am sure it is possible apparently he spoke on sunday with the president of portugal lithuania

cnn russia 's currency crashed to a record low against the us dollar monday as the country 's financial system reeled from crushing sanctions imposed by western countries in response to the invasion of ukraine the ruble lost more than 30 percent of its value trading at 109 to the dollar after plummeting as much as 40 percent the start of trading on the russian stock market was actually canceled the latest barrage of sanctions came on saturday when the united states eu uk and canada said they would expel some russian banks from swift a global financial messaging service and paralyzed the assets of russia 's central bank the united states had been wildly hesitant to do that and uh and apparently now they are going to go forward with this after being forced into it by the europeans president vladimir putin 's government has spent the last eight years prepping russia for tough sanctions they built up a war chest of 630 billion dollars in foreign currency reserves but his fortress economy is now under unprecedented assault at least some of that financial firepower is now frozen according to van der lan the head of the european commission we will also ban the transactions of russia 's central bank and freeze all of its assets to prevent it from financing putin 's war the collapse in the currency prompted the russian central bank to implement emergency measures on monday including a huge hike in interest rates to 20 from 9.5 because basically they are trying to discourage people from taking loans they are saying we need the cash there 's not much that we can lend out at this point so again there are negotiations today those negotiations are highly unlikely to result in anything productive more than half a million refugees have now fled ukraine for neighboring countries at this point so this war is not going as easily certainly as russia thought it was going to be going and the eu is finally mobilizing in the way that it should they have also shut down by the way all flights into the eu from russia at this point as i mentioned the eu uk canada and the united states have planned to cut some of the russian banks from swift which is a major move they did this with iran a few years ago under president trump according to the wall street journal the u.s european union canada and the uk announced new sanctions against russia saying they plan to cut some russian banks off the swift financial network and would take actions to prevent russia 's central bank deploying that 600 billion dollars in reserves to help russia 's economy the joint statements from all of these governments sent a powerful signal of how the west could flex its collective muscle after debating how to respond to russian aggression and this was a significant step up in efforts by western capitals to punish russia for its invasion of ukraine and pressure russian president vladimir putin to seek a diplomatic off - ramp to the crisis so expect inflation supply chains to be attenuated once again expect prices to go up there will be sacrifice that has to be undergone by europeans and yes americans economically in order to fend off russia here and in order to support ukraine and president biden should be asking the american people he should be transparent about this one of the things that 's kind of amazing about this is the spectacle of watching as the united states the white house they are not sure whether they want to be seen as leading this or whether they want to be seen as leading from behind so on the one hand joe biden wants to take credit for this he wants to say that he 's been the one who 's making all this happen on the other hand he pretty clearly is not the one making all this happen so at the same time that the germans who have been again investing billions and billions tons of money into their green energy infrastructure that 's been utterly insufficient and under the table 's been powered by russian natural gas and oil they are cutting off russian natural gas and oil and they are starting to develop their own oil reserves in the united states we have not even cut off russia 's energy sector at this point representative brad sherman from california,0.9725,so maybe they will come out and they will say kamala harris will step in and hope that a new honeymoon period will mean democrats can retain power in the midterms the hill reports harris 's poll numbers rise as bidens fall really vice president harris has rebounded in recent weeks regaining her footing with approval ratings that now stand higher than president biden 's harris got off to a rocky start at the beginning of the administration including a botched response on why she have not traveled to the border when she said she have not been to europe either but her allies say harris whose difficult start provoked questions about her ability to be a future presidential candidate for the party has found her place in the white house quote i think there 's definitely a feeling that things have been smoother said one ally it seems like they have ironed out some of the initial wrinkles julian zelizer a professor of history and public affairs at princeton university said harris has started to solidify her position and strengthen the office gaining a sense always difficult for a vp of what her role should be in the administration the key will be the key will be how those numbers hold as policy controversies continue and politics heats up a gallup poll last week showed 49 percent approved of harris 's job as vice president six points higher than biden 's 43 percent approval rating it 's a significant change for both biden and harris the president fell six six points since august and 13 points since june harris 's current approval rating is the same as bidens in 09 when he served as obama 's vice president the gallup poll conducted earlier this month also revealed the vice president performed better than biden with independence a stunning revelation for a man who has who was catapulted to the white house because of support from that demographic it 's unclear why harris 's numbers have risen higher than bidens in some surveys though biden in the last two months has gone through the most difficult phase of his presidency so far it just started it 's only been seven months yikes man come on biden is received by partisan criticism related to afghanistan and taken hits over the prolonged cronovirus pandemic the president has also been criticized over his handling of the border and immigration taking hits from left and right over an influx of migrants from haiti harris in contrast has been more in the background in the foreground on the controversies though she did win headlines for criticizing why some haitian migrants were being treated uh treated by border agents most democratic strategists and observers say harris has not had a singular moment or two that has boosted her in the public realm nothing specific said basil smickel the democratic strategist and former executive director of the new york state democratic party when asked if there has been a standout moment for the vice president he suggested the white house could actually benefit by doing more with harris other strategists say harris has benefited from republicans setting their sights on biden in recent weeks they have portrayed him as weak on the border in afghanistan quote my instinct is to say that so much fire has been aimed at biden harris 's numbers have gone up by the sheer virtue of being out of the spotlight she 's not giving anyone fresh reason to dislike her so her polling numbers revert to the mean with the country about evenly divided on the black woman in the number two spot and indian do not forget she has asian ancestry that 's according to christie zetzer but harris has appeared to settle into a more of a role into more of a role as vice presidency last week she hosted the leaders of zambia ghana and india separately on wednesday she hosted a meeting with five latino small business leaders harris has been increasingly active politically too giving a forceful speech for california governor gavin newsom fundraising for virginia democratic gubernatorial candidate terry mcauliffe and attending an event at george mason university,0.5817,"right i am not i was never a bitcoin maximalist or any other cryptocurrency maximalist i am a utilitarian freedom maximalist whatever gives the most utility and is the most useful for the most people around the world to improve their lives and create more economic freedom that leads to more economic growth that 's what i want to be out there and promote to the world so bunch of questions but let us just begin with the core promise of bitcoin as we both remember vividly was that i would be able to conduct transactions by goods and services is privately without federal control that there was a there was anonymity because it was digital um and i could sort of have freedom uh in the things that i bought how exactly did they control conversation about that you say that they censored the the discussion boards can you explain exactly how that works so there were two main discussion platforms for everybody was talking about bitcoin and that one was called bitcointalk.org and then another was our bitcoin on reddit and everybody was busy talking about bitcoin in those places and the same anonymous individual managed to get moderator ship position or ownership of both of those forums and one day he decided to turn on the censorship and they would ban anybody that would uh state anything that was not was not in line with the you know small block propaganda about bitcoin and when the censorship first began people started a thread on reddit complaining about about the censorship at that point it was the most upvoted thread ever in the entire history of that bitcoin subreddit and what did they do they then deleted that post as well and banned the people that were participating in that post and the censorship still goes on to this very day if you go on our bitcoin or bitcoin talk.org and post anything in favor of bitcoin being able to scale to be money for the world they will ban your account and uh it 's really really a shame because so the average person that 's involved in bitcoin today they just see oh the price is about $ 100,000 each and and michael sailor 's talking about you know pay your taxes and do not do not be inflammatory uh do not compete with the us dollar that 's going to make visa and mastercard and the the government angry do not do any of that he 's saying literally the exact opposite of what everybody was saying in the beginning of bitcoin which is like this finally gives people a choice as to what form of money they were to use and so imagine if everybody was using bitcoin as money in commerce to you know do their payroll and buy things online and pay for everything how would the us government be able to give billions and billions of dollars to ukraine when most people do not want that to happen how would they be able to spend billions and billions of dollars on all these foreign wars that most people do not want to be able to have happen they would not be able to just inflate it out of thin air suddenly government would be much much more accountable to the people and you know they teach everybody in school",1.1263,"activists are targeting tucker carlson over comments he made on his show about immigration they are sending strongly worded letters to advertisers in an attempt

do someone seems to get offended now what we are seeing from the left is a common tactic instead of arguing facts and trying to refute your points they will just go for your funding source in this instance targeting the sponsors of this show we have seen similar things with other d platforming most notably patreon and subscribe star activists figure the easiest way to shut you down is to cut off the flow of income now what they are doing is not necessarily wrong you are in you are in your right to send strongly worded emails and letters to companies and let them know that you are upset the issue is that people on the other side are not challenging this brigaded they do not engage in this behavior so these companies only see one side and you have to imagine what will a company think when they get inundated with a hundred - plus email saying this is wrong do not do this they can only assume that these people are the general public and they are outraged when in reality it is just the squeaky wheel begging for grease so today let us take a look at what 's going on tucker carlson and i let us talk about the idea of conservatives and the right just not being able to appropriately

ditching tucker carlson on fox news after he said immigrants make the u.s . poor and dirtier pacific life indeed bowflex minted and smile direct club have all said they will not advertise on the show in light of carlson 's comments on immigration carlson is the latest fox news host to face backlash from advertisers after making controversial comments on the air prompting critics to launch a social media campaign to pressure advertisers to pull their ads last week was not the first time carlson has been critical of the migrant caravan at the southern border and he has regularly run segments questioning the benefits of diversity in the us yet thursday segment which was immediately followed by insurance any pacific life being cited as a sponsor seemed to strike a chord with critics carlson said in a show that political leaders are telling us we must admit the world 's poor even if it makes our own country poor and dirtier and more divided by friday morning pacific life announced it had disagreed with the comments and would re - evaluate its relationship with this program as a company we strongly disagree with mr . karlson statements a spokesman for pacific life told buzzfeed news our customer base and our workforce reflect the diversity of our great nation something we take a great pride in on monday in deed and smile direct club confirmed to buzzfeed news that they would no longer be advertising with the show a spokesperson for the job site indeed told buzzfeed news the company had not purchased advertising on the show for more than a month and that it did not plan to do so in the future as a company we are non partisan our site is for everyone regardless of background or beliefs a spokesperson for smile direct club said the company was working with its media buyers to make sure it is no longer running ads around any political opinion shows nautilus confirmed its decision to the hollywood reporter minted an online retailer of local crafts makers said on twitter monday night that it was permanently cutting advertising on the show fox news meanwhile called the campaign against carlson an effort from left - wing advocacy groups it is a shame that left - wing advocacy groups under the guise of being supposed media watchdogs weaponized social media against companies in an effort to stifle free speech a spokesperson for the network told buzzfeed news we continue to stand by and work with our advertisers through these unfortunate and unnecessary distractions and it would seem at least according to buzzfeed news this is an effort from left - wing activists they say matt ribbits the founder of sleeping giants a twitter account that is targeted conservative and right - wing media in the past told buzzfeed news he had sent a letter to carlson 's advertisers in september highlighting his comments on diversity asking them if they wanted to be associated with his views the letter followed a september segment in which carlson asked how precisely is diversity our strength but ribbits noted that none of the advertisers who were forwarded the letter responded at the time thursday segment however took off on social media which leads me to the story from the rap judd apatow calls for expansion of tucker carlson sponsored boycott apatow accuses carlson and fox news of spewing lies and hate at immigrant communities who are just trying to survive in the story they mentioned how judd taou had sent several tweets to sponsors questioning tucker carlson 's show saying hey pfizer what does it say about your company and your moral positions if you advertise on tucker carlson 's show he and fox news get rich off dividing our country and spewing lies and hate at immigrant communities who are just trying to survive maybe choose another show now tucker carlson responded on fox news with a long post saying we are not intimidated we will continue to tell the truth and i think the important thing to realize is that by doing this to tucker carlson you are only inflaming his base you are making them truly believe the things he says without question because you are attacking someone they respect if you want to challenge their ideas be polite and have a real conversation but do not just try and shut them down because then all you do is give fox news and talk across in more press attention fox news has more than enough funding from other areas to continue to make sure that tucker carlson 's show can stay on the air pulling a few sponsors from underneath them is not going to end the tucker carlson show on fox news it will only prove that you are intolerant of different ideas and that you can not actually argue against them not only that it brings more attention to the issues that tucker carlson brought up if you do not like these ideas than what you are doing is in effective integra carlson 's response he says last week we interviewed a man named gennaro lopez lopez is an elected official in tijuana mexico he 's exactly the kind of person you think a lot of american journal to want to talk to for months the media have demanded the migrant caravan from honduras must be admitted into the united states once it gets here they have told us our country will be greatly improved by its presence that 's how immigration works he says how about we just ask this simple question as the caravan made - on a better genaro lopez would know the answer his job is to represent the citizens of that city we have invited lopez on twice to ask what the caravan here 's some of what he told us i asked him behind you it seems that somebody 's cleaning up garbage is there a lot of trash there lopez responded there 's a lot of trash because what i was trying to tell you the 360 people we add here grew to 6,200 and that 's why it got out of hand so we got another facility it 's a big concert hall where you can have 10,000 people under one roof they have more quotes from gennaro things are not getting better there getting worse last weekend we issued an ultimatum to all the hondurans and wada molins that are camping out here on the street they are blocking the street and they are bringing all their necessities trashing the street problems are still going on there 's been like 280 arrests before it was solely for drug possession and being drunk in the streets now it 's for breaking and entering into homes deep platforming works for some people some of the time but fox news is just way too powerful for this tactic and all you have done is made tucker carlson 's fans double down you have given him an opportunity to present more of the same he 's had on another tio on an official to talk about these problems i 'd also like to point out if an official from tijuana is making these statements than who are they to refute it",0.2067,but within a few years the cost increased 35 - fold thanks to litigation awards and as a result companies started leaving the vaccine business to this day there 's disagreement about the primary cause of the brain problems with some of the parents insisting it was the vaccine and vaccine advocates arguing that these children actually had a genetic condition called rivets syndrome possibly brought to the surface by the vaccination but which they would have suffered from anyway there is little disagreement though about what happened next in 1986 the last pharmaceutical company still making the dpt literal told the government it would stop making the vaccine companies making vaccines for other diseases were also being sued and also stopped production the government grew very concerned and in 1986 congress passed the national childhood vaccine injury act ncvia the act established a new system for vaccine - related injuries or death linked to childhood vaccinations wherein companies were indemnified from being sued for safety problems soon after the program was enlarged to include adult vaccination injuries if anyone believed that a child or person was injured by a vaccine they could take the complaint to a newly established vaccine court run by the u.s government and plead their case if they won the government would pay them damages from a fund it created out of taxpayer money this might have seemed the best possible solution the country retained a vaccine supply and citizens had recourse in the event of harm but because companies were indemnified from any harm their vaccines might cause they no longer had a powerful financial incentive to rectify existing safety problems or even improve safety as time passed arguably they were financially disincentivized from doing so the solution shifted liability for the cost of safety problems from the makers onto the taxpayers the pool that included those who were arguably harmed this atmosphere of suspicion spread in the 1990s with even greater explosiveness and toxicity during the vaccine autism debate the landscape of the vaccine discourse in the united states never simple or one - dimensional to begin with was becoming even more complicated and hostile to understand the polarized psychological reactions to vaccination now as well as what to do about it it 's essential to disentangle three things first there is the kernel idea behind vaccination as a treatment arguably one of humanity 's greatest medical insights second there 's the process by which a particular vaccine is produced tested for safety and efficacy and regulated that is the execution of the core insight which as we know can vary in success from one vaccine to the next or fail completely we have not yet been able to make an aids vaccine for instance third there is the way in which those who produce the vaccine and the public health officials in charge of regulating and disseminate it communicate to the public only a person who rejects the first kernel idea could sensibly be called an anti - vaxxer many people accept the kernel insight and have been vaccinated multiple times in the past but have come to doubt the execution or necessity of a particular vaccine and hence also come to doubt the claims made in the course of disseminating it they become hesitant about that particular vaccine and defer or avoid getting it one reason hesitancy can take hold in relatively low trust societies is that reluctant vaccinees typically have no direct relationship with those mandating vaccinations and thus no personal evidence that those people are trustworthy for a regular medication a physician needs and has the ability to convince one patient at a time to take a particular drug this is why pharmaceutical companies have huge marketing budgets to sway individual physicians and patients alike in the case of vaccines companies need to convince only a few key officials in committees who then buy their product and market it for them to an entire population for companies producing vaccines mass marketing is replaced almost entirely by political lobbying a number of events occurred in the 1990s that suggested growing enmeshment between the pharmaceutical industry and scientists involved in drug production and approval decisions along with the role of profit in the whole arrangement was becoming an endemic problem in 2005 the associated press reported that quote two of the us government 's premier infectious disease researchers are collecting royalties on an aids treatment they are testing on patients using taxpayer money but patients were not told on their consent forms about the financial connection close quote one of them was helping to develop an interleukin-2 treatment tested around the globe the problem as those reports noted was that quote hundreds perhaps thousands of patients in nih experiments made decisions to participate in experiments that often carry risks without full knowledge about the researchers financial interests close quote one of the two people running these experiments was a researcher named dr anthony fauci who first rose to prominence a decade before in the aids crisis not only was the assertion about royalties true it was also perfectly legal royalties for public service scientists were first allowed under the bi - dole act of 1980 which had attempted to remedy two related problems the lack of reimbursement for government - funded research and retaining top scientists who were being lured away from public work by the private sector this act and other federal regulations permitted the nih for instance to collect proceeds if its research made money in the private sector and allowed individual government scientists to collect up to 150 000 a year in royalties on treatments they developed at the time fauci said he tried to alert patients to his royalties but his agency rebuffed him arguing that he could not do so under the law the non - disclosure of the researchers interest was changed after the scandal but the damage had been done in the minds of some elements of the public there was something fishy going on between the government and the pharmaceutical industry and it had something to do with money and a willingness to disregard or dilute informed consent these suspicions heightened in the 2000s as key physicians began revealing to the public that big pharma had been involved in a number of major abuses of its relationships with government patients physicians and journals one of the first to break this story was marcia engel who had been editor of the new england journal of medicine arguably the most important medical journal in the united states at the time in her 2004 book the truth about drug companies how they deceive us and what to do about it she argued that the company spent far more on marketing administration public relations and rebranding than they did on research and that they actually discovered very few new effective drugs instead they used quote lures bribes and kickbacks close quote to get drugs taken up by physicians angles showed how these companies penetrated medical schools conventions and organizations often passing off marketing as quote education close quote which they provided free of charge more to the point angle argued that government agencies were highly compromised she demonstrated how conflicts of interest permeated the u.s food and drug administration which gave expedited reviews and approvals for drugs with major side effects like heart attacks and stroke such as vioxx and celebrex and some with no serious benefit engel also revealed that quote many members of the fda advisory committees were paid consultants for drug companies although they were supposed to excuse themselves from decisions when they have a financial connection with the company that makes the drug in question that rule is regularly waived close quote she documented multiple instances of committee members discussing decisions on safety violations committed by the very companies that paid them from which they did not recuse themselves engel 's book which was published to great acclaim was impossible to dismiss as fringe quote dr engel 's case is tough persuasive and troubling close quote claimed the new york times publisher week publishers weekly wrote quote in what should serve as the fast food nation of the drug industry angle presents a searing indictment of big pharma as corrupt and corrupting close quote over the next few years the kinds of abuses she documented made it to the courts as these trials became public americans who suffered from serious side effects caused by the drugs involved took notice in 2012 physician ben goldacre of oxford university published bad pharma in which he explored fraud settlements for pharmaceutical companies covering up known adverse events including lethal ones and hiding information including about safety book 's subtitle how drug companies mislead doctors and harm patients was key physicians often do not know the world was being pulled over their eyes or what had been kept from them but when the practices of large pharmaceutical companies were examined in the courts with internal documents reviewed one illegal activity after another was revealed gold acres list makes one shudder quote pfizer was fined 2.3 billion for promoting the painkiller beckstra later taken off the market over safety concerns at dangerously high doses misbranding it with the intent to defraud or mislead in quotes the largest criminal fine ever imposed in the u.s until it was beaten by gsk clax so smith klein and a quote quote in july 2012 gsk received a three billion dollar fine for civil and criminal fraud after pleading guilty to a vast range of charges around unlawful promotion of prescription drugs and failure to report safety data close quote quote abbott was fined 1.5 billion in may 2012 over the illegal promotion of depakote close quote quote eli lilly was fined 1.4 billion in 2009 close quote quote astrazeneca was fined 520 million in 2010 close quote quote merck was fined 1 billion in 2011 close quote after goldacre 's book was published the fines kept coming johnson johnson was made to pay 2.2 billion in 2013 which including which included according to the justice department quote criminal fines close quote for having quote jeopardized the health and safety of patients and damaged the public trust close quote in 2019 the company was fined another 572 million for its role in the opioid epidemic and then find a whopping 8 billion by a jury in a different case an amount that will no doubt be reduced but which signals public outrage at the violations these huge fines year after year involve popular drugs taken by tens of millions of patients with negative effects including death stories of devastation have become lore in many families and communities the circle of concern is even wider if you if you include those who may not have been personally affected but are aware of this problematic legal history when you personally take a medication you tend to notice news about it especially bad news whether or not you have experienced any negative effects yourself you are naturally alert to their existence each time a big pharma company is in the courts and in the media because of some problem the seeds of skepticism are planted in the minds of many americans and not just skepticism of the company themselves the transgressions mentioned above were only possible on such a scale because of a textbook case of regulatory capture consisting of a mixture of perverse incentives and priorities a tolerance for non - transparency and in some cases a culture of collusion the fda bills big pharma 800 million dollars a year which in turn helps pay fda salaries regulators also often get jobs in the pharmaceutical industry shortly after leaving the fda or similar bodies there is a huge incentive to impress and certainly not to cross a potential future employer it 's useful to see how this works by examining a case that became famous as a tale of epic greed and corruption and which patients and physicians were misled and deceived only after patients families activists and even whole communities yelled themselves hoarse about it for years in 1995 the fda approved oxycontin for short - term serious pain like terminal cancer or post - operative pain this approval was based on legitimate scientific studies related to these narrow experiences the fda then made it available for minor pains with around - the - clock daily usage in 2001 .,0.8107,so if you think five - year - olds really need to take time away from learning to read so they can hear about transgenderism and the hundreds of gender identities they can choose from this bill is probably going to upset you because it will not be allowing that the parental rights bill will instead reinforce quote the fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding the upbringing and control of their children a crazy concept to some people these days the bill prohibits schools from impeding a parent from quote accessing certain records regarding the school 's curriculum and their child 's health it will also prevent schools from encouraging a student to withhold information from their parents regarding their gender identity or other sensitive topics in other words teachers will no longer be allowed to tell eight - year - old kids to keep secrets from their parents about their sexual orientation or mental health and it will require schools to notify parents quote if there is a change in the student 's services or monitoring related to the student 's mental emotional or physical well - being now critics of the bill say schools should be withholding certain information from certain parents because it could keep the students safe if their parents are violent but the bill addresses that saying quote it does not prohibit a school district from adopting procedures that permits school personnel to withhold such information from a parent if a reasonably prudent person would believe that disclosure would result in abuse abandonment or neglect again this is why it 's so important to actually read the bill before commentating on it and despite the media repeating the leftist created term do not say gay to describe the bill nowhere in the legislation is that word even used the word parent is used 32 times the legislation instead zeros in on parental notification and parental awareness of what children are being taught or exposed to in school it essentially serves as a rebuttal against the progressive worldview which says that children are more the property of the state than actual human beings cared for by their own parents we have never invested as much in public education as we should have because we have always had kind of a private notion of children we have not had a very collective notion of these are our children so part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities spelling out in clear terms of parents rights and not teaching five - year - old children about sex especially leftist notions of sexual identity should be simple enough ideas to get behind right florida 's lawmakers thought so the state senate approved the bill 22 - 17 and the house approved it 69 - 47 but as you have seen the legislation was immediately hit with a tidal wave of progressive propaganda if you read mainstream media outlets and their reporting on the bill you will see the same phrase do not say gay repeated over and over and over again president biden himself got in on the action condemning the bill telling the lgbtq community that he has their back the white house called it an attempt by conservatives to make growing up quote harder for young people while the department of education warned florida that schools receiving federal funding must follow federal civil rights law activists are playing the same tune florida democrats rolled through the state capitol building shouting gay gay gay in response to the legislation florida students followed suit staging massive walkouts and repeating chants of we say gay again a word that is not even mentioned in the bill the parental rights bill is now being picked up in popular culture as well the hosts of the view even said that the bill shames kids for who they are is this bill shaming kids from being who they are and punishing teachers who actually want to help them i mean i am not sure what the point of this well considering is i do not understand making kids lives harder than they need to be you know life 's too short for us to do this to the kids again these are kindergartners we are talking about here in many cases they can hardly write out their own names never mind chart the course of their sexual identity and meanwhile in hollywood actors like mark hamill who played luke skywalker in star wars mindlessly parroted the propaganda typing the word gay over and over and over again on twitter as one wise jedi said the ability to speak does not make you intelligent so where is the voice of reason in this whole mess well as has often been the case this year it 's with florida governor ron desantis as the media firestorm over the parental rights bill reached a fever pitch one journalist tried to back the florida man into a corner but desantis was not having it critics called the do not say gabriel was on the senate does it say that in the bill does it say that in the bill i am asking you to tell me what 's in the bill because you are pushing false narratives it does not matter what critics say it says it bans classroom instruction on sexual identity and gender orientation for who for for grades pre - k through three the idea that you would not be honest about that and tell people what it actually says it 's why people do not trust people like you because you peddle false narratives we are going to make sure that parents are able to send their kid to kindergarten without having some of this stuff injected into their school curriculum in the daily wire zone matt walsh has also been leading the charge against the woke propaganda saying quote there is no bill in florida forbidding students or teachers from saying the word gay that does not exist nothing like it exists not at all not remotely what does exist is legislation preventing teachers from sexually indoctrinating preschoolers sounds like he actually read the bill unlike the people that are calling it the do not say gay bill he pointed out that the left is so determined to sexually indoctrinate your kids they are treating this like the apocalypse and that 's exactly what they are doing they want to demonize anyone who supports the law and make it seem like anyone who 's against sexual education for young children is a prude or simply driven by their homophobic or transphobic worldviews there is nothing evil or prudish or hateful about not wanting five - year - olds having a woke sexual worldview forced on them there 's nothing wrong with questioning what your children are learning about deeply controversial and personal ideas the real question is why they are pushing so hard to share those ideas with young children ask yourself who the evil ones really are in this equation i am kava phillips with the daily wire thanks for watching,0.6826,but they seem to believe that everybody who disagrees with them is in league with school shooters joe biden yesterday he said the only reason to own an ar-15 is because basically you are a sicko here 's the president of the united states yesterday what in god 's name do you need a solvent for except to kill someone deer are not running through the forest with kevlar vests on for god 's sake it 's just sick and the gun manufacturers have spent two decades aggressively marking assault weapons which make them the most and largest profit for god 's sake we have to have the courage to stand up to the industry it 's not the gun industry that is making this happen the reason that i own a rifle is to shoot bad people who try to threaten my family that is why i own a rifle that 's why i think the vast majority of americans own a rifle it 's why you have people who are on campus carrying ar-15s depending on which campus you are on it 's why you have armed security guards to act as both a deterrent and actually as a first line of defense if somebody decides to do something like this but the white house 's idea is always gun control and gun control only it 's not just that this is one of their myriad proposals it 's their only proposal it 's the only thing we are allowed to discuss if you discuss anything else you are eliding the problem what about the fact that nothing you pro i keep coming back to this because it 's it 's true and it 's just mind - boggling it 's bewildering not a thing that you have proposed stops these school shootings it does not stop the school shootings and yet you keep proposing these things as though it would so karine jean - pierre she says well you know the answer is to take away guns so first of all unless you are talking about a mass gun confiscation i do not know what policy you are proposing are you proposing a mask on confiscation of hundreds of millions of guns in the united states let us try to put that on the ballot really run on that see how that goes for you see if the american people are willing to do this by the way even when they had a mass gun confiscation and buyback in australia only one third of people who actually own guns turned in their guns the rates of gun violence in australia were already quite low before they had that mass gun confiscation and gun buyback but corinne jean - pierre suggests well you know if more guns were the solution we 'd be the safest country which is just there are many holes in this logic we will break it down a moment america has more guns than people in this country if more guns were indeed the solution we would be the safest country in the world but we are not and so the president has been very clear he wants action he wants to congress to take action he wants to turn this pain into action if more guns were the solution would be the safest country well more guns in the hands of people who are responsible is a solution more guns in the hands of people who are irresponsible and evil is not a solution we all know this so instead of trying to target the people who are irresponsible or mentally ill or sick or evil instead of trying to target that your solution is to try to take the guns away from law - abiding people i have a counter too if more guns were the solution would be the safest country if more gun laws were the solution chicago would be the safest city if more gun laws were the solution washington dc would be the safest city all of this springs from a a deeper notion which the government can solve every problem by passing a law which just is it 's never true government can not solve every problem simply by passing a law it requires human beings to implement that law it requires people to comply with the law it requires people to trust the law it requires a bunch of things to happen even if you were to pass a law confiscating all guns in the country you 'd actually have to effectuate that how many people would die in the effectuation of such a policy so all of this is it 's nonsense,0.8945
i think there are more sectors of government involved we do not do a lot of the things that we are doing now because they were not appropriate the border issues we had cases here that the a the pandemic was first recognized in the united states so that that 's a totally different situation and this is what trump was trying to say last night this trump cut 7:00 today the world health organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic we have been in frequent contact with our allies and we are marshaling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the american people this is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history so you know again again that 's the that 's the kind of thing you should be saying that 's the sort of presidential stuff you should be saying and again i am not trying to suck up to trump you have heard me say good and bad things about the guy i do think he 's doing a terrific job as president i do think he will do the best possible job on this in this crisis because i think he knows you know a lot of the things he said when he was running for office i knew of the best people you know say that stuff a lot of that stuff is actually panned out in a lot of ways he 's gone through a lot of guys but he has ended up with a very good staff i love mike pompeo a love bill bar over in justice i think he does get good people he is using the people that he has and listening to the people that he has so again you know he 's behaving in character he 's behaving as his personality demands which includes some bad stuff and including you know thinking that everything is political thinking everything is personal that he has to be praised all the time those are all traits that trump has but the other traits that he has were listening to experts knowing that he can make knowing how to make decisions knowing how to make snap decisions and big decisions and important decisions he 's very good with that and and all those things are just just coming to the fore i mean that 's what happens in these crises is these they all come to the fore and it 's going to happen to you too it 's going to happen to all of us too because you are going to find out can you control your fear can you control your panic and you do the smart thing and and not you know just go nuts and become a germaphobe you know it 's all it 's all it 's going to test everybody because it 's a real thing i mean on the other side of this talking about that you know after talking about the good news you know there 's all this stuff happening in sports march madness is going to be played in virtually empty stadiums with just the families there they have to go forward with march madness if they are going to have it at all but the nba has suspended the season for a while at least after one of their players ruby gobert rudy gobert of the jazz was tested positive for the corona virus and they suspended the game they let all the players out they let all the audience out,0.1336,the future of conservatism depends on reconciliation beginning november 9th with donald trump flailing in the polls just under two weeks from the presidential election open conflict has broken out between many of the republicans voting for trump and those who see him as a moral and political bridge too far for conservatives and the republican party for most people that conflict is not based on disagreements about principle most never trumpers despise hillary clinton and will not vote for her most never trumpers even feel significant sympathy for the vote for trump to stop hillary argument we believe that trump fails meet the most basic standard of morality and conservatism and supporting him damages republicans politically now and in the future so we are not going to vote for either candidate by contrast most trump voters despise hillary clinton and will vote against her most trump voters are voting for trump as the lesser of two evils not because they support his agenda on trade or trust him as a thoughtful foreign policy sage most trump voters are not laura ingram or bill mitchell or sean hannity that 's been true since may most trump voters will vote for trump because they believe the overriding priority is to stop hillary from entering the white house and to that end they are willing to overlook trump 's myriad flaws so why are the two sides of this debate at each other 's throats mainly it 's because they have been projecting bad motives onto the other side on the one hand some never trumpers have accused trump voters of being high - handed of sneering at them the most vocal trump supporters who spent nearly the entirety of the the general election cycle focused not on helping trump win but on blaming never trumpers if he loses they stated first never trumpers were unimportant to the debate because they are so few and far between then they stated never trumpers were the only things standing between trump and the white house they have argued that all never trumpers secretly want hillary clinton to be president they can not wait for hillary presidency absurd or they do not care about her corruption idiotic or were in the pay of nefarious forces ridiculous the only people literally the only people in this election cycle who have benefited monetarily are those who have boosted their careers by kissing trump 's ass these vocal trump supporters have engaged in the most crash moral preing those who disagree about trump are pure evil sabots sellout now some never trumpers have made the mistake of attributing the rhetoric and feelings of the people who make these yucky arguments the ardent base of trump support to people who are voting for trump reluctantly they feel assaulted and so many never trumpers fail to hear the distinction between intelligent conservatives voting trump as a last resort to stop hillary and trump cheerleaders who want trump to be a bludgeon against the conservative establishment meanwhile on the other hand a lot of reluctant trump supporters have accused never trumpers of high - handedness they believe never trumpers are sneering at them riding their high horses they refuse to acknowledge decent rationales either moral political for not voting trump the never trumpers do not say never trumpers are in the pay the the the prot trumpers do not say never trumpers are in the pay of international bankers or secretly prayed hillary shrines but they claim never trumpers are whiners who will not get their hands dirty and simply want a virtue signal by refusing to vote for trump this misattribution of motives on both sides is really much more likely to spell the death of the republican party than trump himself or trumpism is after the election which trump will probably lose most republicans will grieve never trumpers going to grieve at the lost opportunity to stop hillary clinton and at paving her way by nominating a man eminently unfit and pathologically incapable of running even a half decent campaign that lament the damage done to the party by spending months snorting at sexual assault allegations and shrugging at playing footsie with the despicable alt - right reluctant trump voters are also going to be grieving they are going to grieve at the trump loss generally they will lament both his win in the primaries and his loss in the general but will generally acknowledge that he failed and he failed his supporters in doing so now that does provide the opportunity for a healing so long as both sides recognize the genuiness of the other side 's grief never trumpers have to acknowledge reluctant trump voters felt they had to do what they did they do not bear the stain of his sins for taking a lesser of to evil 's path even if we think that was wrong reluctant trump voters have to acknowledge never trumpers we felt we had to do what we had to do not out of a misguided attempt to demonstrate moral superiority but out of a real abiding belief the only way to preserve conservatism and the republican party is to disassociate from the political electrical fire trump represented no conservative or republican of decency will be celebrating on,0.5075,you know it 's about time that parents and conservative media opponents woke up to schools indoctrinating children with critical race theory which again is a term that should not really be used because it masks the insidious ideology that 's really being spread anti - white ism when i was in college at california state university back in the early 2000s earning my bachelor 's degree in communication 20 something years ago there was an entire class dedicated to criticizing whiteness and my fellow classmates and i thought that it was just some pet project of a fringe white guilt written marxist professor but anti - white ism is at the foundation of many universities across america there are tons of scholarly books attacking white people in american culture under the opes of whiteness studies they are not books that normal people read they are college textbooks that students have to spend h1 or $ 150 on if you have been to college you know how expensive some of the books are and sadly the seeds of anti - his that marxists have been sewing for decades ades have sprouted across the country the university of michigan held a conference titled conversations on whiteness to help white employees become better social justice warriors by teaching them to recognize the difficulties they face when talking about social justice related issues related to their white identity explore that discomfort and devise ways to work through it a professor at fairfield university in connecticut who taught entire courses on black lives matter and critical race theory says that any critical investigation into race should devote some time to the quote problem that is whiteness just being white is a problem now the professor claims that whiteness is a specific power apparatus that exists at the expense of the dpower of black people and insists to be white in the united states is to be a perpetrator of this power apparatus unless one actively and consistently resists in other words white people are are supposed to be ashamed of well being born a sociology professor at cooney the city university of new york teaches that the white nuclear family is one of the most powerful forces supporting white supremacy and says if you are a white person who is engaged in dismantling white supremacy but you start a white family and have white children you are still quote part of the problem students at evergreen state college in olympia washington came up with an idea for a day without white people on campus and demanded that all white students and professors not come to school on their special day so people of color could enjoy the campus without the presence of white people even more bizarre many of the professors went along with the idea but one who refused brett weinstein became the target of an angry mob of students who gather outside of his classroom and demanded that he be fired and he was told that it was no longer safe for him to be on campus and the campus police could not protect him from the angry mob and school officials urged him to quit the president of the college later issued a statement not denouncing the angry mom of students for their ridiculous anti - white ideas and actions but thanking them for their passion and courage his statement began i am george bridges i use he him pronouns catering to the gender identity idiocy that has swept across american campuses in 2021 critical race theory again a stupid term that softens what it 's meant to describe anti- whiteism was exposed largely because of virtual learning kids had to do over their computers while confined to their homes because of the coronavirus pandemic instead of being allowed into the schools parents found out what kind of garbage marxist teachers were indoctrinated in their kids with and sort of showing up at schoolboard meetings and getting involved in the curriculum that 's being taught to their kids and schools in conservative districts began forbidding teachers from telling students that white people or whiteness are the root causes of all the problems in america of course the marxists say that republicans are trying to prevent schools from teaching history and talking about slavery no critical race theory perpetuates the ridiculous idea that every institution in america every law every social norm is infused with white supremacy it 's woven into the very fabric of our society and secretly systemically oppresses people of color it 's anti - white ism pure and simple and is completely contrary to every principle real americans hold dear but indoctrinating students with propaganda that white people are the cause of all the black people 's personal problems is only one facet of anti - white ism being perpetuated in schools some teachers do not want to hear from white students at all during discussions because through the lens of critical race theory white people are second class citizens so they use a practice called progressive stacking another code word for anti - white ism where they predominantly call on students of color and if you are white particularly a white male then your voice does not need to be heard a lot of supposed academics openly support progressive stacking and many others quietly engage in the practice which is obvious to white students whose ideas are routinely rebuffed in the classroom of course for decades universities across the country have used affirmative action acceptance policies allowing lower qualified black students into schools whose grades and test scores are far lower than white and asian students who are denied and for a long time white people were too afraid to sue because they do not want to be called nazis but thankfully a group of asians stepped up their suit was initially thrown out by a liberal judge so they filed an appeal and won and the case went to the supreme court which decided that it 's obviously illegal to discriminate against asians and white people and give unearned favor to black students who have lower grades and test scores thus actually putting an end to affirmative action a code word for black favoritism many junior high and high schools are now engaging in a practice called cultural discipline which means they are not punishing black students when they cause trouble or if they are punished they are literally given a lesser punishment than white students who do the same thing all in the name of racial equity certain groups of students were getting into trouble more often than other students and instead of admitting the obvious that they cause more trouble for reasons you are not supposed to talk about so to make everything equitable and fair they say they issue different punishments based on the race of the students who get in trouble the anti - white ism we are seeing in america is happening in other countries as well many european countries have been struggling with their recent and rampant changing demographics due to mass immigration even in canada at a music festival called the halifax pop explosion a singer announced that she wanted all the white people in the front to give gave up their seats for non - whites and move to the back and when one white woman refused she was singled out as racist the festival later issued an apology to the singer and the other attendees for the white woman interrupting the show because she would not acknowledge her white privilege moving the white people to the back rows was a reference to black people being forced to sit in the back of the bus during racial segregation in the 1950s 70 years ago and a way for the singer to pay back white people and show them how it feels by being racist herself as i said before marxists do not want to end racism they want to use racism for their own ends sadly many black people still dream of getting reparations in the form of free money from the government paid for by white tax dollars at a campaign event a few months before the 2018 midterm election crazy congresswoman maxine waters was asked about it by a and from the national coalition of blacks for reparations in america who asked her to sponsor hr40 a ridiculous reparations bill proposed by democrat representative john conjur in 1989 of course she said she 'd be happy to do that it had always been a laughable idea but as our culture degraded as the marxist gained a foothold in congress and our universities the idea has been gaining steam there are numerous organizations dedicated to trying to get some kind of reparation payments for black people of course they ignore the fact that welfare affirmative action and countless other inner city and minority programs funded by taxpayers basically are reparations and apparently they forgot that not only did white people free the slaves but hundreds of thousands of white people died fighting to do so so there is a simple solution for black people who are incessantly upset by whiteness dominating the culture and white people being the majority in the united states but i can not say what it is because you know how upset they get about certain facts and practical advice you can read all about it however in my books where my uncensored and detailed analysis can be found that is unless amazon bans them which someday they might at the pace things are going so get them while you can order the liberal media industrial complex or hollywood propaganda how tv movies and music shape our culture in paperback from amazon.com or ebooks from kindle ibooks nook or google play and of course there 's a link to the amazon listing in the description below so click it and head on over there and check them,0.2318,this ordinance bans seattle police officers the use of less lethal tools including pepper spray that is commonly used to disperse crowds that have turned violent simply put the legislation gives officers no ability to safely intercede to preserve property in the midst of a large violent crowd it is important to bring to your attention that yesterday i sent the city council a letter ensuring them that as chief of police i have done my due diligence of informing them numerous times of the foreseeable impact of this ordinance on upcoming events the letter is attached for your reference for these reasons seattle police will have an adjusted deployment in response to any demonstrations these will this weekend as i will never ask our officers to risk their personal safety to protect property without the tools to do so in a safe way that 's insane so the seattle pd is already announcing that if you mob a place they are not showing up because they do not have pepper spray because the city council ban the pepper spray they are announcing preemptive surrender preemptive surrender seattle pd is saying you are on your own guys sorry not much we can do also the pd has announced in seattle that they have been arresting people who are firing mortars mortars police have made at least three arrests in seattle pd over the weekend and continue to work to disperse large crowd on capitol hill earlier incident was determined to be a life safety issue violation declared a riot individuals continued to throw explosives and fire mortars at police at least two officers have been injured so that 's what 's happening in seattle where by the way this thing do not start right seattle here we now have this running cycle right this started with chop chas in seattle then portland was like you know what 's great chop chaz let us do that here then the feds came in and then seattle 's like that 's bad the feds went to portland let us do it again solid solid stuff happening all across the country meanwhile in portland chad wolf the head of the dhs the acting secretary of dhs who 's on the show last week he announced that several federal officers may have been blinded they may have lost their vision as a result of these bastards in the streets firing lasers into the eyes of federal law enforcement here 's chad wolfe explaining we have two to three different officers uh we are waiting on final results to see how much of their eyesight will permanently be lost because of the activity of these criminals as you indicated they are shining lasers high powerful lasers in the officer 's eyes as they emerge from the courthouse so we are taking steps we have taken steps to address that uh and we will continue to protect our officers at all costs and again all i need is the city of portland to step up and do their job this is insane insane federal police officers federal law enforcement are being blinded on the job and the media are like trump trump 's so bad trump 's so bad by the way portland 's basically shut down so thanks to the pandemic business was already pretty slow now because they are basically taking over city blocks antifa and tossing trash everywhere they are trusting trash at police officers trying to draw a responsibility response now businesses are not even operating in portland according to the oregonian office buildings remain empty because of the pandemic tourists have yet to return taking away a large customer base for many downtown businesses more tents have appeared along the sidewalks in your downtown as the city has limited cleanups of homeless camps due to the pandemic those factors have limited foot traffic in downtown trimet says trips downtown are down more than 75 this summer compared to last year parking meter transactions are down a similar amount hotel occupancy in the central state is the worst in the state down 73 percent eric murphy controller of mercantile a family - owned downtown clothing store that 's been in business for 45 years reopened his shop in may when oregon governor kate brown eased coronavirus restrictions for many businesses mercantile 's reopening was short - lived thousands of demonstrators took to the streets on the night of may 30th to protest police brutality but the night of a people ended with break - ins and looting in downtown murfree watched on his live security footage feet as looters trashed his stores and police officers failed to intervene he said officers later came to take a statement and collect security footage but have not been in touch since other businesses that were hit that night told similar stories murphy like other downtown business owners said he 's a strong supporter of blm but he is not sympathetic to those that have used the movement as a cover for looting and violence he said he said he hopes his store can reopen in august but he needs assurances his business can be protected the most important pressing thing on my mind is that city leadership is going to do to restore peace and order by the way i i do love the irony of people saying i am the big blm supporter also they are calling for defund the police also i want the police to protect me it 's one thing to say that you are against police brutality like all sentient humans it is another thing to say that you are a big supporter of black lives matter whose chief agenda item is defunding the police and having them not protect law - abiding citizens we are going to get to more places that have turned into centers of chaos across the country in just one second including in in portland there 's a story from ap that demonstrates just how wild things are getting and democrats in denial like open denial and or threatening that this stuff is not going to end unless donald trump leaves office which is saying the quiet part out loud which is basically threatening law abiding american citizens we are going to burn the major cities until we get what we want which is effectively a form of terrorism okay terrorism is the use of violence to enact a political end,0.6111,"but that 's who he 's forgotten about so it 's one thing to say i am going to appeal to the base when 38 % of voters say they are democrats and 32 % say they are republicans it 's a whole another thing when 27 % of people say they are republicans and 27 % of people say they are democrats and 43 % say neither which means they hate both candidates so who 's going to win those people now as nate silver points out the reality is that donald trump is winning those people going away the poll from the new york times sienna asked voters who they voted for in 2020 and then asked them who they plan to vote for in 2024 so bizarrely the poll showed that the recall vote you know people who said they voted in 2020 what they said was that they voted by biden by a 12 - point margin now again that demonstrates this is this is actually a democrat heavy pull because the reality is that joe biden did not win by 12 points joe biden won by 4.5 percentage points but they say that they voted in 2020 this voting base 5341 for joe biden now all those same voters asked who you going to vote for in 2024 said trump 48 to 43 which means biden lost 10 points off of the 2020 vote among these voters and donald trump gained seven points which makes sense right not everybody who shifted from biden loves donald trump but most of them are willing to vote for donald trump so what he says is that in the the poll only 83 % of voters who say they chose biden in 2020 plan to vote for him this year 97 % of those who voted for trump plan to vote for trump again those are swing voters people who are willing to move from one party to the other and there are many of them and the point that nate silver makes is that for every 10 voters who are voting to donald trump fewer than one are switching over to joe biden from the trump camp in other words donald trump is winning independence right now and that means that he is likely to win the election this poll data by the way is supported by further polling over the weekend from both the wall street journal and cbs news according to a brand new cbs news poll when asked how they would rate the presidencies of donald trump and joe biden when they say donald trump looking back was it excellent or good or fair or poor 46 % say excellent or good 53 % say fair or poor about donald trump joe biden so far only 33 % say excellent or good 67 % say fair or poor when they look back on the economy 65 % of people pulled in the cbs poll which by the way shows trump up 5248 over joe biden 65 % say that donald trump 's economy was good compared to 28 % who say that it was bad in the cbs poll joe biden 38 % say the economy is good as opposed to 59 % who say that the economy is bad and again a huge percentage of this is about inflation 55 % of registered voters say that joe biden 's policies make the prices go up as opposed to 34 % who say that donald trump 's policies created inflation because obviously they do not now again these are disaster numbers for joe biden and issue by issue it 's almost impossible to see how joe biden wins this election under these circumstances most democrats are disheartened about what 's happening in this election cycle by the way so are most republicans it turns out that most people generally are not super happy about the candidates they have but they are way unhappier with joe biden why because their their hopes were disappointed joe biden actually i have pointed this out many times when joe biden came into office his approval rating was in the mid-50s close to 60 % he is now down in the 40s when donald trump entered office his approval rating was at like 48 % and when he left office his approval rating was like 43 % in other words people do not have high hopes for trump and then those hopes might have been mildly disappointed i am not talking about republicans i am talking about the general voting base joe biden came into office on the wings of eagles and then he proceeded to drive the plane directly into the ground for himself according to the cbs news poll most of biden 's voters feel the election is mostly about stopping trump most of trump 's voters say that they are voting trump because they like him not because they hate joe biden so democrats not in love with joe biden many switching over to trump disaster area for joe biden again wall street journal poll same same data today trump up 47 45 voters are slightly more upbeat on the economy but they do not credit it to joe biden they are saying that this is happening in spite of joe biden and underlying all of this of course is the simple fact that joe biden is just too old every poll shows a huge majority of people including a huge majority of democrats think joe biden is no longer with us because he 's not and here 's the thing that ai not going to reverse itself get to more on this in

woke and we check the mailbag i am ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show oh man we have a lot to get to today let us just jump right in so the big story of the day continues to be the reverberations the fallout from israel rejecting the request to visit by rashida to leave and ilhan omar to anti - semitic members of congress now this is being completely miss portrayed by the media shock of shocks you mean the same media that pretends that every time tomas organizes a terrorist attempt on the israeli border and then israel has to shoot people attempting to invade its country that israel is the aggressor that same media that routinely defends the palestinian authority which is a terrorist entity which funds terrorists which names streets after terrorists that that same media that champions those folks that they are actually championing ilhan omar and rashid ously i can not believe it i just can not believe it was not the media bias against israel goes back 30 40 years now i am old enough to remember back in the 1990s when my parents canceled their membership to the la times because the la times had run a photo on the front page suggesting that a picture of an israeli member of the idf protecting a jew from being beaten by arab muslims in israel was actually a picture of an israeli member of the military beating an arab muslim in in israel they they canceled their membership to the la times over this the media bias against israel is long - standing and it is not abated in any way shape or form so the media coverage naturally of the ilhan omar rasheeda talib fake visit to israel is similarly egregious all the headlines are israel red checks american congress people and the members of the media are also buying the line put out there by two leoben omar that israel is rejecting them because they are muslim which is eminently untrue and insane to boot 20 % of israel 's population is muslim there are arab muslim parties sitting in the knesset right now members of those parties have called for the destruction of the state of israel but because those members of the party happen to be israeli arab citizens they are free to say whatever they want there are israeli arab members of the not only of the knesset but of the israeli supreme court so all of this talk about israel is wildly discriminatory against muslim arabic is an official language in israel israel has ruled off - limits for jews prayer on the temple mount the holiest site in judaism you have to have a special armed guard to go up on the holiest site in judaism controlled by israel in order to pray up there out of respect for the islamic walk when there are riots up there every year or so the israelis basically protect the right of view of the muslim population on top of the temple mount to riots lead the islamic walk has been destroying historic artifacts up there and the israeli government has been doing nothing about it the notion that israel does not tolerate dissent is obviously insane the only person the only people who could believe that our people who have never been to israel or watched israeli media coverage haaretz which is a major israeli newspaper is not even comparable to the new york times right haaretz is coverage of israel is more akin to al - jazeera than it is to the new york times and that is a major israeli newspaper so this notion that israel can not tolerate criticism or that israel is discriminating against muslims is sheer absolute nonsense and yet that is the way the media is portraying israel 's rejection of rashidah talib and ilhan omar in reality the reason they are rejecting rashida to leave in omaha omar is it is against israeli law for israel to allow people into the country who seek to destroy the country through boycott divestment and sanctions that is a movement that was started by terrorist sympathizers who openly wish to see israel wiped from the map their idea is that if they can get the world community to leverage economic sanctions against israel then israel will be greatly weakened and they have made no secret of this the leaders of the bds movement have made no secret of the fact that they are not interested in forcing israel to a negotiated peace with terrorists instead what they are interested in is israel not being on the map and retreated to leoben ohan omar are part of that movement both of them are anti - semitic rashidah talib has used publicly the dual loyalty samir rashida talib is hung out with hamas sympathizers with hezbollah sympathizers with terrorist sympathizers for large swathes of her career i mean going back to january there was a report in the times of israel about two liba posing with a hezbollah backing anti - israel activist named abbas hamidah who actually painted a picture of her in front of the capitol building wearing the the palestinian scarf the palestinian pride scarf according to the time of israel back in january an anti - israel extremist who has a right to return advocacy group which would call for the importation of every palestinian into israel as citizens which would of course destroy the jewish nature of the state and destroy the democracy attended a detroit swearing - in reception and dinner party for freshman rasheeda talib where he posed with her for a photograph that he tweeted he said i was honored to be a congresswoman to leave swearing - in ceremony in detroit and private dinner afterward with the entire family friends and activists across the country in the picture coming that is holding a painting of talib in front of the us capitol while she is wearing a tub a traditional palestinian gown that she wore during her swearing - in on capitol hill coming as social media presence is noteworthy for its virulence attached on the jewish state he has tweeted things like criminal zionism will eventually die just like nazism no racist and supremacist political ideology should maintain itself israel does not have a right to exist this is a person posing with rasheeda talib at her inauguration at her swearing - in and then she also posed with a second terrorist supporter this is according to stephen emerson ipt news two months after that in march she posed with nader chalo chalo a palestinian activist who last year mourned the death of a terrorist who led a shooting attack that murdered a rabbi so rasheeda talib has not been particularly shy about her associations neither has ilhan omar and they were not being very shy about their associations on this particular trip either because as it turns out the israeli government and i have spoken members of the israeli government members the trump administration about all this the israeli government was fully prepared to let omar and tillie visit and then they saw their itinerary and the israeli government said no this is not a thing that 's going to happen why because the itinerary first of all said nothing about even visiting israel was not about visiting israel it was about visiting quote unquote,1.4701,well yes of course you like it when men pay for dinner because it demonstrates willingness to provide which is an essentially masculine characteristic when you rob men of their duty in life it turns out that men do not just disappear they become toxic when you rob men of mission they redirect those aggressive energies into all the wrong places there 's a great book by george gilder sort of a philosopher economist called men in marriage all about this and his suggestion is that basically men are robber thieves who act aggressively until they are civilized by women and all those aggressive energies are channeled in the direction of building so either men are going to destroy or men are going to build when you shut men out of the building apparatus particularly in terms of building a family when you do not channel men 's aggressive instincts toward protection of wife and hearth and home you end up with aggressively very bad men you end up with no men you end up with really bad men half population still going to end up being men the only question is whether those men are going to be channeling their energies in a positive and good direction or whe they are going to be following wwe light figures who are boasting about their muscles shirtless while driving lamborghinis around and running sex rings right that that those are the choices that you have and there are no other choices either men are going to channel their aggressive testosterone driven instinct into something good productive and wonderful society they are going to build up or they are going to tear down they are going to build cathedrals or they are going to tear cathedrals down there 's no in between there is no man who is redefined to mean woman and if there were that would not be a very good man and what does that mean it means that it is actually a duty of women to allow men to be men just as it is a duty of men to allow women to be women just as it is a fact that it is a form of appropriation for men to pretend to be women and take on all these supposedly female characteristics and it 's a mockery when women do the same with regard to masculinity that is also bad it is also wrong men and women are complimentary and the single best articulation of this comes comes in the book of genesis when god creates woman he creates woman and says that she is aer kdo okay which is the that 's the language in hebrew aer cono means a helper cono against him in other words men and women are not meant to be perfectly equivalent men and women are meant to be complimentary they are meant to bounce off each other they are meant to work in both cooperation and opposition to one another when you get rid of that dynamic which is what barbie seeks to do the barbie movie is all about how men and women actually be better off not really living together barbie does not need ken ken 's an idiot and ken should not be dominating barbie and apparently according to greta gerwig 's theory of life those are the two choices the two choices are effectively either men are marginalized or men are aggressively predominant but the reality is that it 's the beauty of the relationship between man and women that creates civilization when you have a civilization like ours to go back to the theme at the beginning of today 's show a civilization like ours that is built on anti - biblical principles what you end up with is relationships falling apart men who act like aggressive bandits women who are completely unored from the thing that makes them women which by the way does have to do with childbearing and rearing and everyone is less happy everyone is less happy which is why again we have the most prosperous and free society in the history of humanity and we have extraordinarily high depression rates in the west not a shock a cut flower can not grow already coming up apparently young americans are disillusioned with capitalism,0.435,shapiro today do not let the irs take advantage of you get the help you need with tax network usa also you may have noticed that while we are facing a pivotal moment in american history with the election next week there is something legacy media will not tell you and that of course is that israel is fighting for its very survival right now it 's facing attacks from enemies on literally all sides you have got kisb in the north you got kamas in the south you got the hoodies from the south you have the iraqi militia you have the iranians directly you have syrian militia tons of horrible problems over there ordinary citizens just like you and me they have left their families to defend their homeland these brave men and women have been injured fighting for their country survival their families need our help that 's precisely why i have partnered with my friends over the international fellowship of christians and jews right now the fellowship is on the ground in israel providing real help food shelter security to people who need it most just 45 bucks less than the cost of a tank of gas can help provide essential supplies to a soldier 's family during this crisis so here 's what i need you to do right now go to bthe fellowship.org that 's b forthe fellowship.org to make a gift today in the face of these many threats the fellowship 's ongoing work providing security to israelis has never been more important remember ben forthe fellowship.org that 's ben forthe fellowship.org god bless and thank you so for example very easy question let us say republicans are are out early voting what they did last time are those new voters who are voting early or is that voters who would have voted day of who are voting early to get it out of the way in other words are republicans cannibalizing their election day voting in order to get those early votes we do not know the answer to that as nate silver says these are not good baselines especially coming after a co election he says in 2016 the last non - co election michael mcdonald was able to track down a partisan breakdown of early voting data in 13 states some of it is pretty wild stuff democrats led the early vote in west virginia by 12 points but trump eventually won the state by more than 40 more republicans than democrats voted early in colorado but hillary clinton won there similar states can produce surprisingly different patterns he says early vote returns are highly non - predictive of election outcomes on average the d less r margin in the early vote mispredicted the final clinton trump margin by 14 points in 2016 so it could just be wrong also it may be that all of this is accounted for by polls because it turns out that early voting is not a poll it is just count of a select group of people who are voting early and we also do not know who anyone actually voted for like when they say there 's an early vote what they are looking at is the number of registered republicans who voted early versus the number of democrats who who voted early but that does not mean they necessarily voted republican or democrat they could have switched parties for example so not totally clear that party id totally correlates with who you voted for and finally as nate silver points out predictions based on the early vote have a really really bad track record so he says you are probably better off ignoring the early vote almost entirely with the possible exception of john ralston in nevada so he mentioned the nevada early vote republicans are doing better in the early vote than they were expected to by far but he says generally do not look at the early vote as predictive what does that mean means get your ass out to vote that that 's what that really means now with that said apparently there i just warned you not to look at the early vote now i am going to look at the early vote a little bit so political has a piece today saying that democrats are fretting over the early vote in north carolina they say that early vote numbers in north carolina show the electorate skewing older and whiter compared to the state 's voter registration a red flag for democrats who need black voters to turn out in heavy numbers if k harris is going to flip the state by the way if that 's indicative of national trends that 's a serious problem for kla harris take pennsylvania for example in pennsylvania most most of the state just territorially is red,0.414,so there 's two poles one is when it comes right down to it the only thing that you have to rely on is the phenomena of meaning you know when it occurs and when it does not if you are immersed in something you really love one of the one of the phenomena might be that that that self - consciousness vanishes that 's one thing you can see about performers who are really great you know if they are really immersed in what they are doing is that they are very attractive because they have mastered that domain so well that they pay absolutely no attention to themselves as phenomena while they are doing whatever it is that they are doing another thing is if you are immersed in that then your notion of time tends to disappear so you can be working very hard on whatever it is that you are interested in look up and say well where did all the time go and i would say well that 's another indication that that that phenomena is producing an antidote to self - consciousness because a big aspect of self - consciousness is the tick tick tick tick of the consciousness of time what pops you out of that it 's meaning and where does meaning manifest itself well it manifests itself on the border between order and chaos and the reason it does that is because that 's where all the adaptive processes are taking place that 's where you have to be operating in in order to ensure that the phenomena that you use to interpret the world or the structures you use to interpret the world are constantly being updated and also that those of your society are constantly being updated because after all i discover something and then i tell it to you and that 's how so that means that the individual process of creative exploration updates the social world as well so it 's not a simple matter of well the other thing campbell statement for example is follow your bliss well this strikes me as quite quite one - sided in a sense as well and i guess that 's the problem with new age philosophy i mean that 's why i like y 's works on alchemy they said look you look where you do not want to look now if someone tells you that it strikes me that maybe you could believe them it seems realistic to me rather than a message that says well if you do what if you do in some listic sense whatever makes you happy that 's perfectly fine yung is stating through his analysis of this alchemical process that if you pay attention to what you find meaningful it will take you to the place where you would least likely to want to go first not because of because of the necessity of this process emerging the abandonment of meaning ensures the adoption of a demonic mode of adaptation because the individual hates pointless pain and frustration and will work towards destruction of its source this work constitutes his revenge against existence which his pride is rendered unbearable rebirth is reestablishment of interest after adoption of culturally determined competence this rebirth makes the individual as practically adapted as anyone in history and as motivated as he has courage to be the rebirth of interest moves man to the border between the known culture and the unknown nature and thereby expands his adapt of competence his in the world 's in this manner the domain of history is expanded this capability for extension is the manifestation of god within the individual in the modern world socialization should allow the individual to devote the power of history to the act of exploration interest manifested in the absence of self deceit plays each of us on the border of the unknown and removes the tragedy from temporality the pursuit of subjective interest in inevitably brings each individual into contact with his own fears such contact may occur in the social sphere when expression of individuality conflicts with normative behavior or in the sphere of the absolutely unknown when pursuit of individual interest takes man beyond the cultural cannon and places him against the forces that govern mortality and limitation per se the heroic mode of being is predicated upon the assumption that something divine exists within the individual that is capable of manifesting itself when called upon when necessary this is individual possibility that rises to meet the challenge presented by life without faith in the heroic challenge must be avoided from the practical viewpoint this means the abandonment of subjectivity and the search for security this choice eliminates the possibility for further personal development and increases the likelihood of fanatic identification with history or adoption of outright destructiveness self - consciousness means in knowledge of individual vulnerability the process by which this knowledge comes to be can destroy faith in individual worth what this means in concrete terms is that in the course of development an individual may come to sacrifice his own experience because its pursuit creates social conflict or exposes individual inadequacy however it is only through such conflict that change takes place and weakness must be recognized before it can be transformed into strength this means that the sacrifice of individuality eliminates any possibility that individual strength can be discovered or developed and that history itself can progress individuals whose life is without meaning hate themselves for their weakness and hate life for making them weak this hatred manifests itself in identification with destructive power in its mythological historical and biological manifestations and in desire for the absolute extinction of existence such identification leads man to to poison whatever he touches to generate unnecessary misery in the face of inevitable suffering to turn his fellows against themselves to intermingle earth with hell merely to attain vengeance upon god and his creation the human purpose if such a thing can be considered is to pursue meaning to extend the domain of light and consciousness in spite of limitation a meaningful event exists on the boundary between security and novelty the pursuit of meaning exposes the individual to the unknown in gradual fashion allowing him to develop strength and adaptive ability in proportion to the seriousness of his pursuit it is during contact with the unknown that human power grows individually and then historically meaning is the subjective experience associated with that contact in sufficient proportion the great religious myths state that continued pursuit of meaning adopted voluntarily and without self - deception will lead the individual to discover his identity with god and to be thereby capable of withstanding the tragedy of life abandonment of such meaning reduces man to his mortal weaknesses this makes him hate life and work towards its elimination it could be said that meaning is the most profound manifestation of instinct,0.3271,i will listen the same way we do not we see people going off the reservation today is the same way they did before but god saw it fit through the prophets he prophesied he was sin the messiah some people do not believe in the messiah that 's all that 's on you god through his prophet said he was sending messiah to redeem and to be the sacrificial lamb to redeem his people god sent christ through mary mary raised christ christ learned in the law and in him was taught by jewish people right jesus was a jew grew up a jew some of you all may not realize this because religion takes this whole story out of context they see that 's why you never see what jesus did from his birth to when he started his ministry that that part in there is important for you to know jesus was raised by mary jesus was chosen by god jesus went and was baptized and filled with the spirit of god right verified by people who stood around him and they said they hurt the father in heaven say in my son whom i will pleased and they saw the spirit descend on christ like a dove you need to understand these things in plain language jesus had not preached or done anything until he was born again he was baptized and the spirit of god fell on him like a dove it 's in description you can see that you can see the father the son in the spirit and that host stanza jesus went on to preach the gospel with the power of god in him to heal people to preach the message jesus said it very clearly that is not my words but the father that 's in me speak the spirit of god in me is speaking this is what jesus was telling them do not believe me believe the works do not believe me believe that the father is in me and i am in him meaning that we on the same page you are not looking at a flesh being that 's not telling you the same thing that the god that you have known from abraham we are not saying something different we are on the same page because god dwells in me by way of the spirit same way that god dwell in you if you have god 's spirit in you let us continue jesus spoke to his apostles he hath them he taught them he told them to go out before he ascended that he would to preach to the nations and baptize them keep that in your mind but jesus had to be a sacrifice he went to the cross he could have escaped the cross they could have hid him somewhere he could have did all that,0.5314,the democratic party has been in civil war for years now ever since bernie sanders had the nomination stolen from him 2016 and we then saw chaos the nevada caucus people called the police it 's escalated then with media smears against bernie bros and bernie sanders himself recently being being claimed it 's been claimed that russia was backing up bernie sanders to disrupt the american election and now the civil war has gone from bad to worse to ugly because apparently democrats have been calling the police on bernie sanders supporters and it 's not just that first we saw project veritas exposed the insane rhetoric of the bernie sanders campaign which for some reason no one in the media called out but many bernie supporters of the lock down their accounts we then learned that a bernie sanders staffer was disparaging other candidates he actually got fired and now not listen to this the reporter who exposed the bernie sanders supporter is getting harassed and doxxed because the bernie sanders people are at war with the media with the democratic establishment and it is getting so bad they are literally calling the police on bernie sanders supporters recently bernie sanders won the nevada caucus in a landslide good for him good for you bernie in response tons of media personalities wigged out and acted like the sky was falling tip for the most part on msnbc it now seems like they are all starting to bend the knee because bernie sanders is winning but let me tell you something it 's getting ugly i literally have a story pulled up from political that says cops repeatedly called on bernie backers their late - night bullhorn protests at public officials homes come as sanders opponents are increasingly calling out his supporters behavior we all know about the the bernie bros smear,0.834,"everybody knows to some extent the power of the mainstream media and its ability to shape public opinions many are aware that the pointless information that they present to the masses as if it were something of importance is designed to create a self - fulfilling prophecy and try to give the appearance that it is actually important as well as the complete blackout non - coverage of issues that should often be the top story but adding to the confusion is the fact that prominent members of the conservative mainstream media who claim daily to be fighting the deep state never actually scratch beyond the surface of partisan politics and never address the true power structure operating behind the scenes instead these hosts will focus on partisan issues many of which are of little significance and they will never address key issues such as the bilderberg group the bohemian grove or operation mockingbird intelligent people have varying degrees of suspicion that the us government is in bed with the american mainstream media and anyone who monitors the news with discerning eyes can quite easily identify specific stories and strategies that are being used to persuade and intimidate the population for those who want evidence of such manipulation one needs to look no further than the findings of a senate select committee in 1975 which confirms this has occurred for decades on a scale larger than most people could imagine through their investigation it became clear that such a program was developed in the 1950s for the purpose of persuading americ american and foreign media as well as to use the media as gatekeepers to prevent certain information from being published and breaching the masses it 's called operation mockingbird because a mockingbird repeats what it hears songs from other birds just like the media outlets repeat what they hear from their handlers in the cia in 1948 an espionage and counter intelligence branch within the cia was created for the purpose of spreading propaganda engaging in economic warfare and giving assistance to underground resistance groups to engage in subversion against what were seen as hostile regimes and later that year operation mockingbird was established with the goal of influencing domestic and foreign media philip graham the owner of the washington post at the time was first recruited to help set up and run the project within the industry and develop a network of assets who were also recruited in the early 1950s operation mockingbird had influence over 25 different newspapers and wire agencies and and this network of intelligence assets also involved major television broadcasters including william paly the ceo of cbs thomas braden who was the head of the international organizations division the iod which was a division in the cia dealing with human intelligence services would later reveal that quote if the director of the cia wanted to extend a present say to someone in europe a labor leader suppose he thought this man could use $ 50,000 he 's working well and doing a good job he could just hand it to him and never have to account to anybody there was simply no limit to the money it could spend and no limit to the people it could hire and no limit to the activities it could decide were necessary to conduct the war the secret war it was international according to the congressional report published by the church committee which uncovered operation mockingbird quote the cia currently maintains a network of several hundred individuals around the world who provide intelligence for the cia and at times attempt to influence public opinion through the use of covert propaganda these individuals provide the cia with direct access to a large number of newspapers and periodicals scores of press services and news agencies radio and television stations commercial book publishers and other foreign media outlets the committee also concluded that the cost of the program was approximately $ 265 million a year which one of adjusted for inflation as of 2023 means that in today 's dollars the program cost nearly $ 1.5 billion a year after the church committee released its findings on operation mockingbird rolling stone magazine published an article written by carl bernstein of watergate fame who named various prominent journalists he alleged were involved with it some of these included ben bradley who wrote for newsweek stuart olopp who wrote for the new york herold tribune james from the new york times charles douglas jackson a writer for time magazine walter pinkis from the washington post william c bags of the miami news and others in 2007 a large amount of documents known as the family jewels were declassified and released by the national security archive which also revealed that the cia had routinely wiretapped illegally washington based reporters who were seen as a threat to the establishment because they were not playing along with the propaganda and gate keeping efforts within the media establishment and just like every other case of rampant institutional corruption in government agencies once it was discovered the cia claims to have ended the program which is laughable and sadly carl bernstein realized that he could not beat them so he decided to join them and has functioned as an operation mockingbird for many years now under the disguise of being a cnn contributor since the internet has been a haven for independent journalists and countless alternative news sites along with bloggers who have gained large followings of people who do not rely on mainstream corporate news to get their information this posed a major problem for the establishment the major broadcast tv and radio networks as well as cable channels require tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment and expensive services such as satellite feeds camera crews in order to function but the internet had open the door for one individual the website costing only a few dollars a month to have the potential to reach millions of people simply by posting their own articles or videos even before social media people were able to copy and paste a link from a blog and send it out to their email list and a simple blog written by an ordinary person could go viral so of course the establishment saw the dangers that blogs and nonmainstream media websites held for their monopoly of information so they decided to use prominent bloggers as paid propagandists just like the talking heads in mainstream media in 06 a report from the joint special operations university titled blogs and military strategy outlined this plan saying that they should hire a block of bloggers to verbally attack specific people or promote specific messages and the report also suggested that the government hack blogs of those seen as detrimental to the propaganda that they want to spread and just start changing around a few words or post fake articles that are then attributed to the original blogger but then came social media an extremely powerful way for people to communicate with each other and reach large numbers of people so the government got to work and set up a new program in order to flood social media with operation mockingbird propaganda the us government launched a program called operation earnest voice sometime around 2011 using specially created software that allows them to create and manage fake social media profiles or sock puppet accounts of dozens or even hundreds of fake people in order to use them for propaganda purposes to not just post content online but then create an entire comment thread to create a false consensus around that material or so that one person could flood the replies of other people 's posts in order to steer the conversations and overall appearance of the comment section they claim they only do this on websites and social media platforms outside the united states because technically until president obama amended the smithm modernization act in 2012 it was a violation of us law for the military to create or distribute propaganda aimed at our own citizens but we know how close the government follows the law in fact the twitter files the internal communications published by elon musk after he took over the company revealed that operation ernest voice was using twitter although the name of the operation was not mentioned in the twitter files it 's obvious that 's what it was because the activities were identical the twitter files confirmed that under the leadership of jack dorsy the company whitelisted or allowed centcom us central command to operate fake accounts to sway public opinion in places like iraq syria kuwait yemen and elsewhere in the middle east every country engages in information warfare and today that means flooding social media with bots and trolls to promote certain topics and attack certain people and disrupt various comment threads the london guardian surprisingly admitted into 2015 that quote israel defense forces have pioneered state military engagement with social media with dedicated teams operating since operation cast lead it 's war in gaza in 2008 2009 the idf is active on 30 platforms including twitter facebook youtube and instagram in six languages china is known to have used sock puppet accounts on twitter and youtube and everybody knows that russia used social media to sew discord in the 2016 presidential election promoting both prot trump and anti - trump content causing democrats to have a meltdown we can never forget though that the russians do not support donald trump that 's a hal truth they also attacked him and supported black lives matter because they just wanted to cause chaos and further destabilize the united states one of the biggest black lives matter facebook pages called blacktivist meaning black activist get it which had over 3 60,000 followers was part of russia 's information war against the united states since there was no easier way to cause division and ban the flames of racism then get behind black lives matter a marxist movement and let us not forget that michael moore helped promote and attend a protest outside of trump tower in new york city that was actually organized by russia as part of their social media manipulation campaign adam weof the founder of the illuminati secret society back in the late 1700s which contrary to popular belief is a historical fact founded in bavaria germany and then later spread throughout europe and into the united states under the cover of the skull and bones brotherhood at yale he knew the power of controlling information 250 years ago and in one of his letters which were confiscated by the authorities back then once the illuminati was discovered he wrote quote by establishing reading societies and subscription libraries and taking these under our direction and supplying them through our labors we may turn the public mind which way we will meaning whatever way they want reading societies were like book clubs because obviously back then there was no television or radio so people read books and often got together to drink and discuss politics and philosophy in this particular letter he went out to say that in like manner they need to obtain influence in the military academies and in the printing houses and take control of the printing presses in the bookstores and in short any office that has any effect in forming or managing the mind of man he and his fellow illuminists also understood how controlling newspapers can be used to smear their enemies one correspondence reads quote we get all the literary journals we take care by well - timed pieces or articles to make the citizens and the princes a little more noticed for certain little slips their certain little slips refers to anything they say or do that will not be looked at favorably by the public and the illuminati 's well - timed pieces will be sure to inform people of this if they do not like that person so as you can see the more things change the more they stay the same i am mark

kill a baby with arms and legs and eyes and hands a baby with a heart and a face almost anywhere in the u.s up until the point of birth and if the governor of virginia 's to be believed you can kill the baby even after birth most americans think that this is insane it was a recent survey from the harvard center for american political studies and harris poll found that most americans 70 percent believe that abortion should only be permitted in the first trimester or in cases of rape and incest a whopping 94 of americans believe there should be some restrictions on abortion unfortunately the remaining six percent seem to comprise every leftist politician and activist and mainstream media mouthpiece in the country the vast majority of americans want restrictions on abortion and the left is clamoring for abortion on demand without apology funded by your taxpayer dollars how does the left force their unpopular abortion policies down everybody 's throats well they convince you that the issue is very complicated they convince you that men half the population can not have an opinion on the subject never mind that women are more likely to identify as pro - life than men are and that 's according to democratic pollster celinda lake never mind that the same leftists who tell us that men can not have an opinion on abortion are also the leftists who tell us that men can actually have abortions i am looking at you julian castro they are the same leftists who tell us that men really are women and women are really men but the men anyway can not have an opinion on abortion they will do anything stoop to any depth to prevent you from recognizing that babies are people but of course babies are people they are people one day after they are born their people one day before they are born they are people because they are human and they are alive which means they are people all the way from the very beginning it is not the case that babies become people at say four weeks old and before that they are eagles or something if they were eagles before that then you would not be able to kill them you would go to jail but because they are humans you are allowed to kill them babies are people from the very beginning we can know this with certainty simply by using our faculties of reason but let us look closer for evidence at all the facts that the left does not want you to know within the first four weeks of pregnancy the baby 's eyes face mouth jaw throat and heart will begin to form today you can kill that baby anywhere in the country by six to eight weeks the baby has ears the beginnings of his brain spinal cord nervous system digestive tract sensory organs and bone by this age she has a heartbeat in 43 states you can kill her by 16 weeks a baby has fingers toes eyelids eyebrows eyelashes fingernails hair teeth bones a functioning nervous system and fully developed genitals at this stage she can suck her thumb and yawn and in 43 states you can kill her by 19 wakes you can feel your baby move and also in 41 states you can kill her by 21 weeks your baby can respond with movement to the sound of her father to sounds outside of her mother 's body at this point your baby can survive outside the womb and also in 40 states you can kill her by 23 weeks your baby 's eyes will open she will have visible fingerprints and toe prints and she will very likely survive if born prematurely also in 29 states you can kill her at this point the laws begin to get blurry 22 states then impose certain degrees of legal bans on killing fully formed viable infants notably seven states do not nothing at all oregon is a great example of this oregon has had no abortion restrictions for the past three and a half decades that means a mother can murder her baby as she gives birth with no penalty at all and oregon is not alone among these barbaric states even states like new york new york purports to have restrictions on abortion but they do not they actually leave the door open to abortion at any point up until birth through vague language regarding quote threats to the life of the mother to be clear abortion is never medically necessary but by pretending that it is infanticidal politicians such as new york 's governor andrew cuomo can hide the enormity of their laws such as the recently passed reproductive health act this law in practice permits abortion up until the moment of birth it actually goes even further to amend the new york penal code such that prior to the law 's passage if you killed a pregnant woman you 'd be charged with double homicide after this psychopathic law was passed that penalty was diminished you would only be charged with a single murder andrew cuomo when he signed the bill into law had the audacity to say god bless you all to the pro - abortion politicians he then lit up the world trade center in pink better to have lit it up in red cuomo 's law was welcome news to anthony hobson anthony hobson earlier this year murdered his pregnant girlfriend by stabbing her in the stomach prosecutors initially hoped to nail him on double homicide but thanks to cuomo 's law hobson now faces a far lighter sentence new york has long been key for the abortion industry new york shows us also the particularly devastating effects of abortion on minority populations nationally 36 percent of all abortions are performed on black women even though black women constitute just 13 percent of all women in new york city 41 of pregnancies end in abortion that is a horrifying figure in and of itself but just among black women the number jumps to 60 percent more black babies in new york are aborted than born in 2011 the pro - life group life always put up a billboard in the city that pointed out that the most dangerous place in new york city for a black child is in his mother 's womb this was met with shock and defense the black city councilwoman leticia james called the billboard quote highly offensive the life always board member stephen broden also black noted that the billboard is far less offensive than the genocide of black babies currently taking place in new york while white leftists like andrew cuomo smile and applaud now in governor cuomo 's defense something i never thought that i would say in my entire life at least he is not as bad as the democratic governor of another state that pretends to have abortion restrictions namely virginia back in january clanhood aficionado governor ralph northam said on radio that if a baby were to survive an abortion in virginia that baby could simply be murdered after birth he said quote if a mother 's in labor i can tell you exactly what would happen the infant would be delivered the infant would be kept comfortable the infant would be resuscitated if that 's what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother a discussion would ensue over whether or not to murder the living breathing baby sitting right there on the operating table the left rejects the whole discussion the left says oh come on it 's the 21st century we are simply keeping up with the rest of the world but that is not true in fact the united states is very much an outlier in its barbaric embrace of abortion in france a nation that is in many ways far more progressive and secular than the united states abortion is severely restricted in france you can only procure an abortion up until the 12th week of pregnancy the people who invented the guillotine have a more life - affirming view of abortion than we do 12 weeks that is a far cry from making the baby comfortable before snuffing out its life on an operating table in virginia beyond the mere crime of killing an innocent baby abortion threatens so many other aspects of society and causes so many other social ills saint teresa of calcutta explained how during a wonderful speech to the united nations in 1994 .,1.0897,the pax americana right the idea of an american hegemony dominating the globe faced a well - coordinated challenge from china russia iran and north korea in the early 2020s the first move was the invasion of ukraine the second was the war of iran 's proxies against israel the third will most likely be a chinese challenge to american premacy in the indo - pacific perhaps if xan ping is bold a blockade of taiwan if in the course of 2024 ukraine 's position becomes so vulnerable that its forces must withdraw from some contested territory three immediate consequences will follow first more refugees will flow from ukraine to europe second private investors will take their money out of ukraine and third european governments will have to get a lot more serious about their own defense spending with all the obvious political headaches that implies for nato as a whole to hit 3.5 % of gdp on defense spending would require $ 431 billion more per year nearly twice the amount all countries have pledged to ukraine since last year the px americana seems to be ending the fate of ukraine of israel of taiwan hangs in the balance i can not say i am sur surprised he says it was always very likely the overreach of the global war on terror would be requited in this way with a resurgence of isolationism and that 's what 's happening inside the biden administration now the realist foreign policy that donald trump pursued was not in fact an appeasement oriented foreign policy the idea that europe should pay its own way when it comes to military spending at the united states would still be a muscular player in the world was not a bad idea from donald trump the idea of getting rid of nato entirely was a bad idea but the idea that nato should actually be paid for by many of our allies was of course entirely true they were relying on us for years to pay the freight when it came to their their military spending the problem is joe biden came into office and his strategy has basically been to say broad things that do not materialize in the way that he would like them to so for example the ukraine war joe biden never made clear what the exact interest was in the ukraine war let us say that joe biden at the very outset had said listen the interest in ukraine is not to reverse the gains that russia made in 2014 because those are not reversible at this point given the state of the war the the purpose here is to repel any future russian invasion of ukraine and we will provide military support necessary to do that even in perpetuity we 'd be willing to do that right now the broadscale perception in russia would be that russia is losing the war because they did they tried to invade ukraine they lost it do not work the united states through its proxy in ukraine was able to completely degrade the russian ability to make large scale war in ukraine that is a victory for the united states and yet somehow it has turned turned into a loss why because joe biden never anticipated and never articulated what exactly his goal was instead he basically said zalinsky will establish the goal over in ukraine and zin 's goal is not the united states 's goal zelinsky 's goal is repel russia from the donbass region from crimea get push them out of all of those areas but that was never realistic that was never going to happen no matter how much military aid america provides unless the united states is willing to start sending over f-16s if that 's not going to happen there 's no way to break the block the strangle hold that russia has on those areas and so right now vladimir putin is just waiting out joe biden he because republicans have correctly said we need to know what the plan is here and joe biden is not articulating a plan now putin is simply waiting it out so over the course of last week putin said that they are going to increase the strikes on ukraine putin 's bet all the way along here has been very simple i am going to outlast the united states the history of russian war making is expend way too much material and way too many men in pursuit of a military goal because the history of russian military conquest says we do not really care very much about our own citizens and we are willing to throw hundreds of thousands and millions of people at a problem going all the way back to world war i the russians were perfectly willing to sacrifice millions and millions of people charging frontally blocked positions charging machine gun positions with no weaponry so the idea that they are going to expend lots andot like that 's actually part of the russian military mentality the notion that he 's going to be pushed off the ball by joe biden basically saying zinski can make the case here like that that 's not going to do it so putin is going to continue to ratchet up the pressure which is what he 's doing russian leader vladimir putin said moments ago that russia will increase its air strikes on ukraine in the coming days weeks and months this comes as ukraine says that odessa on the black sea coast came under assault from unmanned russian drones just hours into the new year one person died at least nine were injured i basically putin 's betting that the west is simply going to give up on this and the reality is that because of fails failures to articulate the goals and the strategies the west may in fact give up on ukraine now if that happens it is much more likely that china is going to become ever more militant china is watching a west in retreat around the globe from powers that should not have the west in retreat forget about russia which is a nuclear armed power when you look in the middle east the fact that the west is being basically challenged by a bunch of ragtag pirates in the red sea is totally insane the fact that the west is somehow hand ringing over a democratic ally israel trying to destroy a terrorist group kamas that just committed the worst act of of jew murder since world war ii and and the west is sitting around hand ringing what do we do what do we do how far should the israelis go china 's watching all of that and they can see it that is a west in retreat so over the weekend us navy sank three houie boats that were were attacking a merchant ship in the red sea this according to abc news us navy helicopters returned fire and sank three small boats carrying houie militants in the red sea on sunday after us warships responded to a dist distress call from a merchant vessel according to military officials a mayor container ship the singapore flack hangu issued a distress call at about 6:30 a.m. local time according to centcom the merchant vessel said four small boats were attacking it helicopters from two us ships uss eisenhower and uss gravely responded and issued verbal calls to the small boats according to us officials now remember the biden administration delisted the hoodies as a terrorist group when they came into power and right now you basically have us military assets that are sitting out there and having to wait to blow up these tiny inflatables being driven by illiterate morons with badly programmed drones it 's insane meanwhile iran is upping the game iran 's albor warship has now entered the red sea according to the semiofficial tasnim news agency and reuters tasnim did not give details on the alor mission they said iranian warship have been operating in open waters to secure shipping routs combat piracy and carry out other tasks since 2009 there 's the fear that iran may be upping its game meanwhile what is the obama what is the biden administration doing according to the jerusalem post a us aircraft carrier is now being removed from this area so as the challenges are being upped against shipping in the red sea the us is removing the uss gerald ford instead it 's heading out of the mediterranean like to go where exactly where else is there a massive ca problem that requires the help of the of of of this us battleship like what what why is the ford leaving no one exactly knows so iran is upping its aggressiveness in this area and meanwhile the united states is withdrawing an american aircraft carrier china is looking on and thinking to itself man we are fools if given our current economic situation we do not make a move for taiwan again all the bills are going to come du this year all the bills are going to come du this year and by the way it 's only going to get worse if the united states continues to strain its relationship with israel over israel getting rid of an overtly evil terrorist group in kamas which is embedded itself in a civilian population forcing israel to sacrifice hundreds of its own soldiers and also if the united states says to israel that israel can not go after hezbollah to protect its own citizens in the north and weakness is taken in world politics as a sign that you are ready to allow the bad guys to win and china knows this which is why china is getting more aggressive according to the wall street journal chinese leader xiin ping has now urged his countrymen to brace for more economic challenges in the year ahead sounding a cautious note as a string of weak readings highlights the many heads facing the world 's second largest economy he said on the path ahead winds and rains are the norm some companies are facing business pressures some people are running into difficulties finding jobs and in their daily living all of this could easily be the predicate to the idea that the the chinese window is closing and they need to move and they need to move right now while joe biden is president as in this year do not be surprised if a lot of the hot spots around the globe start to heat up even more we will get to more bills that are about to come do particularly for the american left in,0.8912,trump leads harris by five points in arizona when you looks at that real clear politics polling average which again is not just one poll it is an average of many polls it shows momentum for harris no question it shows that she is currently leading in the real clear politics polling average in nevada wisconsin michigan and georgia but all of those races are within margin of error and similarly for president trump he is running a little bit ahead in north carolina and arizona and they are tied in pennsylvania literally every single one of those states is within the margin of error at this point in time not just that if you look at nate silver 's prediction for what 's going to happen in this election right now he has donald trump with the upper hand and the reason for that is because kla harris really got almost no bounce from that democratic national convention she may have hit the high water mark of her campaign and the turning point could happen as early as next week on tuesday when donald trump and kla harris finally debate the rules for that debate have now been set the mics will be muted there will be no audience now innately i think a lot of people thought originally that that sort of rule would would hurt trump because he thrives off the crowd and he he likes to throw a punch but the reality is that it contains donald trump is much better for donald trump because it turns out that donald trump not appearing to be erratic is the key to him winning at this point kla harris 's entire campaign tim walls ' entire campaign the entire thing is based on the idea that donald trump is a crazy man who can not be trusted with power so if donald trump does not appear to be a crazy person in the debate he is going to be on solid footing and really there are only a few things he has to do in that debate to successfully throw kamla harris off of her game the number one thing he has to do is simply mention her record simply point out her flip flops she is a target rich environment politically speaking and she has some real systemic problems in some of the key states stes nate silver points out over at his website today that while kla harris is up by three and a half points in the national pole tracker she has fallen below 50 % chance of winning the electoral college and some of that is because of pennsylvania pennsylvania was widely perceived as the state that matters the most in the presidential election how how goes pennsylvania that 's how the election goes very hard to imagine a scenario where donald trump for example wins pennsylvania but loses say georgia and north carolina and similarly very hard to see a scenario where kamla harris wins pennsylvania but loses michigan and wisconsin pennsylvania is almost certainly the most important state in this election and the problem as nate silver points out is that it 's been a while since we have seen a poll showing harris ahead in pennsylvania which is the tipping point state more than a third of the time in their model in fact they added one post dnc model showing pennsylvania as a tie and another showing either a tie or trump up plus one and as we know the polls tend to under sample trump voters because trump has specific appeal for what are called low propensity voters people who do not necessarily vote in the last presidential or midterm election it 's very difficult to model what the electorate looks like when donald trump is on the ballot this is one of the problems with the polling it 's not all purposeful skewing of polls there 's a lot of talk about how the pollsters skew the polls and how they are looking for particular outcome before they even calculate the final number that is not really true pollsters do have an interest in trying to be accurate but they have a really tough time trying to measure the nucle nulear reactor that is donald trump in a campaign very very difficult to measure who is part of the electorate who is not who do you reach how do you actually construct a model of the electorate does it look more like 2016 or does it look more like 2020 for example these are very difficult questions now again as silver points out all this could change quickly with one or two high quality polls showing harris ahead in the keystone state but for now they show a 17 % chance harris wins the popular vote but not the electoral college which remains a very serious possibility so again right now kla harris does not have this thing secure not only did she not have this secure she did make one giant mistake and i pointed it out at the time that was selecting tim walls as her vice presidential candidate tim walls is a black hole of suck he is just a terrible candidate tim walls continues to run from questions he continues to give off a a strange vibe a weird vibe here he was the other day running from questions to do about lower ask question asked if he 's going to answer any policy questions and uh that 's going to be a big no that 's going be a big,0.5806,and it 's a taxpayer - funded institution university of north carolina taxpayer - funded institutions are not the same as private universities if she 'd been hired at a private university i would say she should keep her job if she 's a public university that 's your taxpayer dollars taxpayer dollars are a very different thing alrighty meanwhile crypto currencies you may have noticed took a serious dive over the course of the last couple of days according to the uk daily mail bitcoin has rallied after plunging below the 40 000 mark for the first time in more than three months as tesla boss elon musk insists the company will not sell any of its holdings in the cryptocurrency despite the turbulence celebrities and others who bought in early are still up big but small investors who jumped on the bitcoin trend in the past few months may have suffered some ruinous losses this is one of the problems with bitcoin right now is that because the amount in circulation in terms of being used by that many people is still not that high it can be disproportionately affected by swings from celebrities who decide that they are not going to engage in more bitcoin use for example investors had rushed out of cryptocurrency earlier wednesday after china sparked to market panic when officials announced a regulatory crackdown and this just demonstrates by the way how important bitcoin is going to be for the future of economic freedom because more and more governments are going to start cracking down on bitcoin in the same way that during the 1930s government started cracking down on the private ownership of gold because if you can trade in currencies that are not government currencies this allows you to divest from the government 's inflationary policies and this is the thing that the government can not allow this has always been my great fear for bitcoin which effectually is just a form of precious metals that has been that has been digitized that 's really all that bitcoin is the volatility in bitcoin right now is ineffective nobody knowing whether or not governments are going to even allow the circulation of bitcoin but long - term i am not sure that governments can prevent it which is why i have been a bitcoin fan for quite a while the the bitcoin had hit like 30 percent drop before it retraced most of its losses after elon musk 's vote of confidence by late afternoon trade in new york the currency was still down about 10 on the day,1.0611,quote why you wonder well people who listened to the debate on the radio which many did because not everyone had television back then thought that nixon won but the people who saw the debate on tv had a completely different conclusion the reason is this there were a bunch of hot lights on the stage which were needed to properly light the candidates and because nixon refused to put makeup on to take the shine off his face which today everyone on tv knows is a standard practice he looked pale sweaty and shiny while kennedy had a tan from campaigning outdoors and the days leading up to the debate and took the advice of the producers and wore makeup so he looked to be radiating health and confidence to the viewers who were watching tv whereas nixon looked kind of sickly and weak but the advent of television has transformed society in many other ways television news is very different from newspapers or magazines which tend to cover stories in much greater detail and context than a 15 second sound bite and require a reader 's active attention and willingness to follow a story television on the other hand is a passive medium and often relies on a quick pace flashy graphics and dramatic music in hopes of gaining an audience 's attention and holding it long enough to make it to the commercial break so they can get paid tv news if it even qualifies as news only skims along the surface of issues mentioning a few basic points and is often just infotainment with no real substance what the audience sees is a carefully crafted version of a story that the producers and the editors want people to see while leaving out the parts that they do not want the reason intelligent people listen to talk radio or podcast is because those formats provide long - form interviews and in - depth discussions which explore subjects in detail during a 15 or 20 minute segment and may even continue the discussion after commercial break for even longer in comparison the average television news segment on a national evening news broadcast is under two and a half minutes for local tv news it 's just 41 seconds television news is the equivalent of reading the headline of a newspaper article and the first paragraph or maybe two aside from the limitations of the television format the days of walter cronkite the most trusted man in america who anchored the cbs evening news for 19 years are long gone after his era was over we got people like dan rather who used fake documents in a report about george w bush 's service record from when he was in the national guard brian williams who fabricated a story about his plane being shot down in iraq when he was covering the war and everyone knows the clowns on cable news are even worse everyone knows hollywood celebrities make millions of dollars a year but most people do not think about how much money celebrity journalists make they too are performance artists not much different from a hollywood actor reading their lines they know when to sound somber and when to turn up the energy and display fake outrage to the audience when the teleprompter tells them many of them do not believe half the things that they say they are just playing a part and for that they get paid very well for example before he was fired from nbc news anchor brian williams was making 10 million dollars a year dan rather was making six million dollars a year at cbs anderson cooper over at cnn makes 12 million dollars a year and has a net worth of well over a hundred million dollars chris cuomo was making six million dollars a year at cnn matt lauer was making 25 million a year before he was fired from nbc 's today show to put these figures in perspective anderson cooper 's 12 million dollars a year divided by 52 weeks in a year is over 230 thousand dollars a week or 46 000 per show he makes more money in one day than many americans make in an entire year and for that kind of money these television personalities will say and do almost anything all of the big three broadcast networks nbc abc and cbs try to separate themselves from the cable shows but promoting the liberal agenda remains at the core of their existence they also are not without their major scandals that should cause viewers to question their integrity as news networks cbs once killed a story about the tobacco industry covering up how addictive cigarettes are out of concerns that if they were sued by the tobacco companies for their report it would interfere with the pending sale of the network to westinghouse the incident was later made into a movie called the insider in 1999 starring al pacino and russell crowe you may have seen it after burying a story about nike using sweatshops to manufacture their clothes out of fears that they would lose the company as a sponsor for the 1998 winter olympics cbs reporters wore nike jackets during the coverage as part of the sponsorship deal and what was widely criticized as a breach of journalistic ethics after abc news interrupted the network 's broadcast for some breaking news about the russia investigation brian ross falsely claimed that michael flynn had implicated donald trump in the conspiracy resulting in the stock market immediately dropping 350 points out of concerns that the president was now going to be impeached or arrested general flynn made no such allegations and the story was completely false like all of the stories about the russia witch hunt a few years earlier during their breaking news coverage of the shooting in an aurora colorado movie theater by lunatic james holmes anchor george stephanopoulos said that brian ross found something that might be significant he went on to then incorrectly report that the shooter may be a member of the tea party because abc found someone on facebook who had the same name and had the tea party listed as one of their interests of course it was the wrong james holmes abc news claimed that then attorney general jeff sessions delivered a speech to a hate group after meeting with the christian nonprofit organization alliance defending freedom one of the most powerful christian rights organizations in the country basically all christian groups are seen as hate groups to the liberal establishment which always cites the southern poverty law center as the ultimate authority of such things because they are massive christian folks as bad as the big three broadcast networks have become in recent years though cable news channels like cnn and msnbc are sadly much worse they will talk endlessly about the same story on every show every hour all day all week all month really to ensure maximum saturation hoping their propaganda will reach as many viewers as possible since most people just tune in for an hour or two a day they are still talking about the january 6th protest at the capitol almost every single night on almost every single show it 's like being stuck in the movie groundhog day but in hell normal americans wonder how anyone could watch cnn or msnbc ever again after the massive fraud those supposed news networks engaged in during the trump administration by perpetuating the massive russia hoax and countless other fake news stories but it 's easy to underestimate how many stupid people there are out there after all the jerry springer show aired for 27 years and was able to keep audiences coming back every day to watch another group of trailer trash fight with each other about who cheated on who and who the father is some poor child and despite how mindless and repetitive the show was enough people kept tuning in every day for it to stay on the air for almost three decades

curve flattened just a bit marcus walker from the wall street journal reports italian authorities believe the country 's coronavirus epidemic is slowing down appreciably after three weeks of national lockdown a hopeful sign for other western countries that are following approach is similar to italy 's with the time lad italian officials and health experts said it will take until after easter to cut new infections enough to begin loosening the lockdown and reopening parts of italy 's economy silvio bruce affair o presidents of the national health institute italy 's main disease control center says we seem to be arriving at a sort of plateau which shows that the measures are working meanwhile there 's new cdc data that is out showing that the people who are most at risk are obviously we have seen this already people who are suffering from pre - existing conditions people have chronic medical conditions like diabetes lung disease heart disease they face an increased chance of being hospital with kovan 19 and put into intensive care according to new data from the cdc that is consistent with all the reports from china and italy as well the new data gives the most sweeping look at the way cocoa 19 is causing serious illnesses among people in the united states who already face medical challenges the report reinforces a critically important lesson although the disease is typically more severe among older people people of any age with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk if they contracted the virus now that is true but again the people who are most at risk are the people who have those underlying medical conditions the pre - existing conditions covered in the cdc records include heart and lung diseases diabetes chronic renal disease chronic liver disease immunocompromised conditions neurological disorders neuro developmental or intellectual disability pregnancy current or former smoker status and other chronic disease the cdc found of people requiring admissions when i see you 78 % had at least one underlying health condition of people hospitalized but not requiring icu 71 % had at least one such condition compared to 27 percent of people who do not need to be hospitalized in all cases analyzed ten point nine percent of patients had diabetes nine point two had chronic lung disease 9 % had cardiovascular disease there is no report as to as to whether severity of disease correspondents a pre - existing condition but with all of that said obviously those with pre - existing conditions are at the highest levels of risk now as i have said one of the questions about the modeling in all of this is going to be what is the time delay factor here so that university of washington model i said earlier eighty one thousand deaths by by july they are talking about eighty four thousand deaths by august something like that and then total they are saying like somewhere between 100 and two hundred and forty thousand deaths hard to see how if we have eighty four thousand deaths by august and there 's a second wave that that does not look really a lot higher by the time we get to the end of the year i mean that the fact remains that we are seeing a second wave of diseases that are breaking out in asia as well and that does raise the question of how we reopen all of this home and jenkins over the wall street journal asks that question he says he says experts are now planning ways to get americans back to work with mass testing and mass provision of masks and gloves second thoughts about the lockdown are not to only to economic costs accumulating evidence seems to show cova nineteen spreading to the most vulnerable from close family contact rather than casual interactions the experts recovery plan tend to be mum on whether the goal is to slow the rate at which we get exposed or save us from getting infected altogether the polling data on which president trump made the decision this week to extend social distancing guidelines can be read as most americans believing they should be kept safe from ever getting the virus but is that even possible holman jenkins says if we were being as candid in the us as they are in australia each of us might be asking ourselves the herd immunity question so i belong among the 60 % who need to get infected or the 40 % who should avoid all exposure until the epidemic snuffs itself out he says i tend to think of myself as on the bubble this is right when we get back to work we are going to have to determine who is the most likely to get the disease and die from the disease as people go back to work because this can not last indefinitely it just can not there is no way that we can be in august and everybody is still working from home not with the unemployment rate shooting up to in excess of 30 % that 's not going to work everybody is for long people everybody 's taking salary cuts everybody is laying people off and you can not just float people money until the end of time that 's not something that is even possible and as i say asia has a new wave of virus cases that demonstrate that this thing is not going away anytime soon according to the new york times in china international flights have been cut back so severely the chinese students abroad wonder when they will be able to get home in singapore recently returned citizens must share their phones location data with the authorities each day to prove they are sticking to government ordered quarantines across asia countries and cities that seem to have brought the coronavirus epidemic under control are suddenly tightening their borders imposing stricter containment measures fearful about a wave of new infections imported from elsewhere the moves pretend a worrisome sign for the united states europe and the rest of the world still battling a surging outbreak any country 's success with containment could be tenuous the world could remain on a kind of the indefinite lockdown but here 's the thing that lockdown can not in fact remain completely indefinite right there is no way for the lockdown to remain completely indefinite given the fact that the fed can not just continue floating people money forever and the bloomberg is reporting the federal reserve is now acting as the central banker to the world by seeking to provide the global financial system with dollar liquidity it needs to avoid seizing up in its latest measure to combat the economic fallout from coronavirus the fed said tuesday was establishing a new program that was designed to provide liquidity across the world it was establishing a temporary purchase agreement facility to allow foreign central banks to swap any treasury securities they hold for cash so we are going to give them cash they are going to sell us back our bonds so basically we have got treasury buying back all of the bonds which essentially means inflation that 's yet another step beyond the actions it took in the 2008 financial crisis former fed official ted truman now senior fellow for the peterson institute for international economics in washington says so the federal reserve 's credit it is playing the role of central bankers of the world rather than denying it and trying to ward it off the fed is trying to prevent a liquidity squeeze amid a worldwide rush into dollars as the virus wreaks havoc on a global economy that is dependent on the dollar as its linchpin julia coronado founding partner of macro policy perspectives in new york former fed economists said in an interview a lot of borrowing and commerce and investing is done in dollars when you have a dollar crunch it can turn a recession or contraction into a financial crisis very quickly because the dollar shortage can trigger defaults and deleveraging meaning people start calling in their loans the loans are bad people who have have loaned to the lenders or who have securities that are backed by those loans start to default so the fed is basically inflating well you can not inflate forever,0.6702,but that 's not the way i am raising my kids and there are many parents who are not raising their kids to believe that all forms of sexual experimentation and sexual identity are morally equivalent and you know what it 's not the job of the schools to cram that down i care about my kids more than you do i care about my kids more than the schools do i care about my kids more than gavin newsom does so gavin newsom believes that if your kid goes to school and tells the teacher you know i am thinking i might be bisexual or i am thinking i might be a member of the opposite sex the teacher has no duty to tell the parent whatsoever and if you say that the teacher has a duty to tell the parent that and and actually allow the parents into the circle that the parents ought to be the head of because the parent is the person who has a duty to the child and you have delegated that duty to the teacher only insofar as the teacher does the will of the parent in educating the child gavin newsom believes that the parents are the enemies of the kids that 's what that 's what he believes he tweeted out this is nothing short of state - sponsored intimidation of lgbtq children it will put kids who are already navigating stress in physical and psychological danger for the sake of these kids do not do this florida so the idea is that parents should have no authority over children none teachers should have authority over children parents are child abusers now there 's been no evidence in the state of florida like if the kid goes home says i am gay mom and dad and they beat the hell out of the kid that 's child abuse and cps shows up if the kid goes home and says i i believe a member of a different gender than my biological gender and the parent abuses the child there are laws on the books to prevent that sort of thing but what what the left is now saying is that if your kid goes to school and starts engaging in radical gender ideology or starts engaging in left - wing belief systems about sexual orientation and the malleability of sexual behavior and the innate goodness of all different forms of sexual behavior equivalent goodness of all these things the teacher should hide that from the parents should has a duty in fact to hide it from the parents and if you say that they should tell the parent this means that you are a bad person it means that you are a bigot and probably a child abuser you know the the militants attempt to separate kids off from their parents is despicable it 's the worst thing going on in american life right now the worst thing going on in american life right now is an attempt by the left to suggest that parents do not have any duty or authority over their kids that the state has the duty and the authority and therefore can protect kids from their parents without any accusation or evidence of any abusive behavior on the part of the parents that 's vile according to wfla the amendment instructs revision by replacing the relevance section with protocol for how school leaders can develop a plan using all available governmental resources to tell parents of their child 's sexual orientation through an open dialog and a safe supportive and judgment - free environment that respects the parent - child relationship and protects the mental emotional and physical well - being of the child so they are trying to portray this as though you call the parent in the kid says they are,0.6543,but i think many people will look at the numbers and say it 's probably there 's probably some correlation here according to npr remington declares chapter 11 amid trump slump in gun sales firearms manufacturer remington outdoor has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in hopes of staving off creditors amid a slump in sales and public outcry over gun violence reuters reports that remington 's creditors including franklin templeton investments and jp morgan asset management have agreed to exchange debt for equity in the company although its financial troubles go back further in recent months the company has found itself on the losing end of a phenomenon in which higher gun sales are seen under democratic presidents as gun enthusiasts feared greater gun control and drop under republicans for example firearms sales were brisk under president barack obama when polls showed hillary clinton was likely the next president gun sales hit a record only to drop off precipitously after the election industry observers have dubbed the current downturn in sales the trump slump according to npr under democratic presidents due to a fear of gun control gun sales skyrocket and most people feel like that 's true but it tends to be anecdotal we do have some information for manufacturers and a lot of people at gun shops tell these stories about how whenever there 's call for gun control or whenever there 's a democratic president people want to buy more guns in case you can not get them later and because trump as seen as being better on gun control people are not buying so gun sales are not down it does not seem like there 's a direct correlation between mass shootings and gun sales but following the shooting with more calls for gun control it 's entirely possible that we will soon see gun sales start going up because people who do like guns who are gun enthusiasts or pro - second amendment are scared of having gun sales restricted or potential bans so then the question becomes what is actually happening with the march for our lives well right now we do see gun sales going down many people believe gun sales will go up we have seen more donations to the national rifle association when march for our lives becomes one of the largest protests in american history and the news cycle is dominated by the gun control debate once again people start to hyper focus on these issues as more and more people call for gun control it is likely in my opinion that we are going to see more people donating and buying guns so let me know what you think were you under the impression that this was a mostly youth - led movement as much as i think some people wore under than impression i feel like most people kind of knew it was going to be the same people who typically go out and protest in these big events anyway it does not seem like anything 's really changing and in my opinion it 's going to be all very predictable i think gun sales are going to go up i think donations are going to go up i think the protests will have the opposite reaction these people want unless their goal is to encourage gun sales but what do you think did you expect this to be mostly young people and what do you think 's going to happen with the gun debate are there going to be meaningful reforms will more republicans come out and just vote to defend their right to bear arms or people who are just pro - second amendment comment below we will keep the conversation going thank you all so much for watching make sure to stay tuned to new videos every day at 4 p.m. you can follow me on twitter at tim cast and i will see you all tomorrow,0.8728
i have seen this too it 's appalling paul thank you so much for coming on i hope you will come back and talk about this some more really interesting conversation thanks a lot any time any time thank you thanks well a little depressing i am afraid but still honest and straightforward and that 's something i have seen as i have traveled around the thing that appalls me every university that i go to and the college that i go to is not the kids who show up and you know squirt michel moles it 's not the kids who protest it 's not the hecklers or anything like that it 's always the administration giving a working against free speech feeling that they have reached the stage where their conversation can end the conversation can end because they have gotten that 's that 's my final reflection which goes back to what 's happening in france and what 's happening in europe and what 's happening at the universities here listen i can not tell you to believe in god i can not tell you to reconstitute the things that make you free that make you as prosperous and free and and power and this country is powerful as it is but you ought to know it 's abuse that you have been kept in ignorance it 's abuse when young people are kept in ignorance when they do not know when you have people like ilan omar saying this country is founded on you know genocide or whatever and injustice this this is a kind of nonsense to talk about what it is this country that it is that people like scrabbled out of the mud for thousands of years with powerful people 's boots on their neck to build a country where they could be free certain ideas went into it you do not have to go back and embrace those ideas but if you do not even know what they are what will you say what will you say when the revolution shows up at your door and says they are there why do you believe what you believe this is the thing that really bothers me because i went down so many wrong roads because i explored so many mistakes so many errors because i adopted so many ways of thought without really thinking them through and then fought them through to the point where they collapsed i know what i think i know why i think what i think i know what my axioms are those things that can not be proved but without which the entire system collapses do you do you know those things i mean they are there for you to find you know a paul mentioned shakespeare shakespeare basically invented the idea of a human being that is in your mind now if you do not know a little shakespeare if you have not seen shakespeare if you have not thought about shakespeare you do not know why you think you the things you think you do not know in what context you think those things and when the revolution comes because the revolution comes to places where art where people have forgotten how to defend the things that they love and the thing is you know you can defend those things with bullets and rifles and armies and all those things are necessary but if you can not defend the ideas you get the the society gets eaten out from within and that 's what paul ray was think was talking about and that 's what you saw at notre dom is the cathedral the civilization the country and its religion got eaten out from within and that 's what nobody wants to talk about,0.1252,trump is a con programs like new day with chris cuomo cnn tonight with don lemon the rachel maddow show and morning joe all contributed to the explosive growth and all had one thing in common they milked the trump campaign and presidency for every ounce of ratings that they could president trump president trump president trump president trump president trump trump trump trump trump trump trump 's trump trump the trump campaign trump campaign the trump campaign the trump campaign trump campaign it 's the trump campaign donald trump trump russia trump campaign the trump campaign the trump campaign trump campaign it do not matter what he said or what he did everything became a story at the dessert course he gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream with his chocolate cream pie the new york times giving us some insight including his daily regimen of watching up to 8 hours of tv and drinking as many as 12 diet cokes like the way he drinks water the president reached for a glass of water during his national security speech the president needs to use two hands apparently to drink from a water bottle they talked about what he wore what he ate how much he weighed and of course his hair and then there were the tweets every statement every picture every typo and every meme became a story and a point for conflict the network 's also focused enormous amounts of time agonizing over the unsubstantiated russian collusion story impeachment and his pitch for the supreme court trump became the antagonist that cnn and msnbc had been waiting for only cnn would ask that question fake news go ahead they even said he was complicit in hurricanes a damning washington post editorial is calling president trump quote complicit in this storm not for failing to prepare but for failing to address climate change 2020 brought a new flood of viewers as the media blamed trump for nearly every aspect of the kova 19 pandemic how it began how it spread and how every human was doomed the 2020 election also helped to provide the biggest news ratings year ever everything changed however when trump was banned from social media in january of 2021 and left office soon after the media lost their treasure trove of content and suddenly they had nothing to talk about it only took about 50 days for cnn to lose 1.6 million of their primetime viewers that 's a drop of 36 and only a few weeks even worse half of the viewers in the key 25 to 54 age group tuned out which means prices for advertisements also had to drop significantly the story over at msnbc was the same they experienced a 41 decline between march of 2020 and 2021 .,0.4966,so i asked him what he meant he told me that the idea of time and schedules was created by white europeans and that i was stuck in a colonial mindset he talked about how indigenous populations do not have these notions and that other cultures do not share the same idea of waking up and adhering to a schedule that all of this was built by white people well i explained to him that many cultures understood the concept of time and adhered to schedules that it was not exclusive to white people but he simply replied that all of this was because white people colonized these cultures and pushed these beliefs onto them specifically for me he told me that asians only followed a schedule because white colonists brought this concept to the far east this is just one anecdote but trust me there are many more i have encountered many activists who tend to be white people on the far left who genuinely believe that the greatest accomplishments and the worst crimes have only been committed by white people to me this is essentially erasing the accomplishments and crimes of other cultures of which every human every culture every tribe in this world has done something that is considered wrong by today 's standards so i started to realize something as this person was lecturing me about how my heritage coming from the far east was actually derivative of white colonists i realized that this is some kind of new idea this new kind of white supremacy here i am sitting in front of a white man who identifies as a far left activist genuinely believing that not only did white people create most basic concepts like time and a schedule but that they are supreme that my ideas and cultures are derivative of their culture now let me clarify what this means this is not a group of people who think that why people should be supreme as how we traditionally define white supremacists but a group of people who think that why people are supreme that they hold power and are above all other races in terms of access and privilege to hear from so many people associated with the far - left that the idea of white privilege extends beyond western colonization but actually affects the accomplishments of east asia and the middle east was actually rather shocking to me because anybody who knows even a little bit about history knows that there are great accomplishments across all cultures around the world white supremacist is typically defined as someone who believes the white race is inherently superior to other races and that white people should have control over people of other races but many people associated with the far - left share at least half of that belief to be told that your culture only exists because of white people to me might not be the same as our colloquial understanding of white supremacy but it is something drastically similar and while this is not representative of all activists on the far left obviously it is an idea that in my experience has extended among many activists and many of those who are white on the far left seemingly paradoxically white people who oppose racism but genuinely believe that they that their culture that their ethnicity is dominant and holds more power and privilege than any other and this becomes a particularly dangerous paradox when you have white people who believe that they do have the majority of power and privilege but then demand minority groups adhere to their ideology because they know better and we have seen instances where mixed race and minority people were physically attacked by white anti - fascists again i am not trying to act like this as every single anti - fascist or every single leftist or even everyone on the far left just that there are much too many people who associate with what we call the far left that genuinely believe these things and i do not know how to quantify how many people that is but i have encountered enough of them to where it has really soured my understanding of these activists now it 's basically a meme among my followers that i mention my being mixed - race because i have pointed it out on several occasions but there is a reason why i do this among the far left when i agree with them they will use my minority status to their advantage but when i disagree with them they will accuse me of just being another white man my principles my thoughts my intentions they mean nothing and this extends to a much larger problem where many people associate the far - left are trying to make everything political simple video games and movies become political statements and then we see movies get negative reviews from critics because they do not like that it may have glorified some concept like the movie death wish the movie was not overtly pro - gun it was not talking about the right to own guns and the main character actually illegally obtained guns yet critics were so quick to lambast this movie saying that it was a gun nut fantasy they actually gave the movie a bad review for political reasons that had nothing to do with the movie and this plays into something that dave rubin said recently he tweeted out that they want you to bow forever because it does not matter what your principles are it does not matter if you oppose racism it does not matter if you agree with them it simply matters if you are willing to let them have the power and stand down now the issue might not even really be left or right,0.1984,barack obama has spent the last several years drilling home the statistically evidence - free idea that police across the country are systemically racist hours before a black anti - white racist massacred five police officers in dallas you remember obama said police shootings in louisiana and minnesota which he said he knew nothing about were quote not isolated incidents they are symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system after the cops were shot obama went to their funeral memorial and lectured america about the e of police officers he said quote we also know that centuries of racial discrimination of slavery of subjugation of jim cro they do not simply vanish with the law against segregation we know that bias remains we know it whether you are black or white or hispanic or asian or native american or of middle eastern descent or our a pokemon we have all seen this bigotry in our own lives at some point no institution is entirely immune and that includes our police departments we know this carrying that message forward cnn 's baraki sers argued on sunday that quote we do not have a vicious cycle of black men shooting at police that narrative ratchets up the tension in this country where it does not need to be but two it puts in danger more black men well except that 's not so true if there 's any systemic bias in america it 's media produced politician promoted anti - cop hatred in the black community here are three facts that prove it first cops are far more likely to be shot by a black person than to shoot a black person heather mcdonald of the manhattan institute author of the war on cops she makes the point that blacks are far less less likely to be shot by police than would be suggested by the black crime rate just as importantly quote police officers fa an 18.5 times greater chance of being killed by a black male than an unarmed black male has of being killed by a police officer second often blacks thing cops are criminals without any evidence after officer darren wilson shot michael brown under disputed circumstances misreported by the media blown up by racial agitators including the president polls showed that a 57 % majority of black people wanted to see officer wilson found guilty of murder and presumably go to death row compared with 56 % of whites who said they needed more evidence of course wilson was innocent brown was a strongarm robber and attempted cop killer similarly during the oj simpson case 60 % of blacks do not believe oj was guilty the police must have been framing him in the freddy gray cr 80 % of blacks thought the officers several of whom were black ought to be charged compared with 60 % of whites all of the officers charged have now gotten off third blacks are far more likely to profile cops than the other way around while 59 % of whites have either a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in cops only 14 % have little or none the numbers are awful among black folks just 37 % of blacks have a great deal or quite a lot of trust in the police 25 % have none at all as of 2014 74 % of black people said the police were too quick to use deadly force only 28 % of white people agreed this by the way is contrary to the facts a new study from harvard showed whites are significantly more like ly to be shot by police than black folks the left claims that all anti - cop bias in the black community springs from historic mistreatment some of that 's true but it 's not wholly true young people do not live or grow up during jim crow instead they have been encouraged by the media and by their politicians to see police as the enemy and that 's reflected in both action and viewpoint that 's not to deny there are many young people who feel as though they have been targeted by cops but it is to say there is way way more evidence of anti - cop bias than anti - black bias in police forces i am ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show tend to demonize people do not care about your feelings,0.6103,"so yesterday afternoon governor greg abbott of texas issued a letter basically announcing that the state of texas was going to start enforcing the border they ' been doing this for a while they put a bunch of fencing in the middle of the rio ground barriers in the middle of the rio ground to prevent people from crossing the border the federal government has objected to that they have used razor wire in state parks that are on the national border and the federal government has objected to all of that well yesterday greg abbott looking at the crisis that has been created by joe biden on the southern border issued what is a rather historic letter we are going to go through it in its details because what we are watching is now a constitutional crisis that is created entirely by joe biden and his evil activities on the border and they are i am sorry it is an evil thing not to enforce the border of your country to purposefully say that you are going to leave the border wide open which is what joe biden has done i have been down to the border it is wide open to facilitate that to basically incentivize the drug cartels to pour millions of people into the united states is a bad thing it is joe biden abandoning his constitutional duties it is joe biden abdicating the presidency of the united states it is an evil for the president of the united states to do those things it would be the equivalent of a mayor of a large city simply announcing that they are not going to police crime anymore the fundamental duty of the federal government is to protect the people of the united states of america and to protect the borders of the united states of america that 's why it is a ferally mandated duty for the for the government of the united states to do that that 's why it 's a federal issue and not a state issue and joe biden has not only signally failed he has done the opposite of good he has facilitated all of this in the estimates on the number of illegal immigrants who have entered the country it ranges from a low the low would be like 6 million people have entered the country illegally under joe biden there 's certain estimates that put that upwards of 10 million and there 's no real way to know because of course there are a bunch of people who ran across the border and god away and those are unknown goda ways they are known goda ways and unknown goda ways but joe biden has facilitated all this with terrible border policy it is wrong it should be against the law again the federal government has one job and one job only in the in the end and that is to protect you to protect your rights there are already laws on the books that prevent illegal immigration those laws have been in place for decades in the united states it is up to the president of the united states to enforce those laws and again it is worth noting here that leaving the border wide open is not just incentivizing the me drug cartels to move millions of people across the southern border it is incentivizing the mexican drug cartels to move tons of fentel across the southern border which is being used to kill effectively 100,000 americans a year depending on the numbers that you are using when it comes to drug overdose those drugs are pouring over the border again this is all facilitated by joe biden 's policy this was not a problem during the latter years of the trump administration it just was not and it is under joe biden and it is a manufactured crisis because joe biden has decided just legally speaking that he was going to get rid of roma in mexico he was going to suggest that if you arrive on america 's southern border throw up your hands and say i am here because i fear to go to my home country then we have to process you and release you into the interior of the united states within 72 hours that is basically how joe biden 's border policies work and he has staffed 90 % of border patrol on bussing and administrative duty leaving the rest of the border wide open for the mexican drug cartels he 's turned bard patrol into a fery service for illegal immigration you can ask members of border patrol they will openly tell you that that is what they are now it used to be that it was their job to track down people who are illegally crossing the border so they could be detained and then deported and now it is their job to basically act as a facilitation service for illegal entry into the country why is joe biden doing this and there must be a rationale because he is so committed to open borders that he is scuttling his own desire for ukraine aid for israel aid for taiwan aid in order to keep those borders open republicans have proposed fixes on the border that would for example most important fix would be not only the reinforcement of remain in mexico which was a trump era policy that joe biden refuses to enforce which would simply say that if you are applying for asylum you have to wait in mexico while that asylum request is processed which would mean that most of those people are not getting in the country as opposed to now they arrive and then again we detain them for 5 seconds and then release them and they quote unquote wait in the interior and then never show up again it 's not just that joe biden 's asylum policies they need to be fixed in order to claim as in the united states you should have to show the burden of proof is on you to show that you actually require asylum right now you do not even have to make a colorable argument that you require asylum you just claim that you do and then release you into the interior hr2 which is the republican bill that would shore up all this joe biden is rejecting all aspects of that even if it means scuttling the aid that ukraine actually needs in order to maintain its war against russian invasion why would he be doing that there are only a couple of possible reasons one is obviously political that joe biden and a lot of democrats believe that many of the illegal immigrants who are crossing the border are going to eventually become democratic voters and for all the people who are saying well you know they they can not vote because they are illegal immigrants you do not need the illegal immigrants to vote all you need to do is for them to get married you have a bunch of young single men who are crossing the border all they have to do is marry an american citizen and they are now sponsored for citizenship they can now get their green card which moves them towards citi plus there is the bet that the democrats are making that eventually somebody 's going to amnesty all these folks and they will become american citizens at which point they are going to vote for democrats and why would democrats not think that given the fact that many of the people who are crossing the border right now are chanting joe biden 's name i mean there 's video of it or maybe it 's because joe biden is ideologically captured by his radical left flank a radical left flank that believes that america is in fact a guilty country on the world stage and therefore has some sort of moral duty to open its borders wide to anybody who wants to come into the country whatever the reason joe biden has abandoned his duty as president and all of this is the predictable result so the predictable result is that the state of texas is looking at this and they are saying we are getting smacked in the face by illegal immigration we are being told that we have to basically swallow it when the federal government decides not to enforce the law and this raises a bunch of really deep legal and constitutional issues but we have to lead with the moral because here is the reality joe biden could solve this tomorrow by simply enforcing the border and by the way the american people should solve this by not re - electing joe biden that would solve this too we will get some more on this in just one second but first folks 2024 is going to be a wild ride we have of course already seen the impacts of inflation at the gas pump and the grocery store the dollar is losing its purchasing power and has lost a lot of purchasing power over the past few years so let me ask you a question how are you protecting your savings consider diversifying with gold from the birch gold group for decades gold has been the choice of investors and central banks to hedge against inflation i myself have invested with birch gold to diversify my portfolio that 's just a smart way to invest birch gold can help you create a wellth thought out and balanced investment strategy they will help you convert an existing ira or 401 k into an ira in gold without paying a penny out of pocket and this month only when you open a gold ira with birch gold you will get a free signed copy of my book the authoritarian moment",0.735,and i think then israel will swivel and try to broker a deal with the saudi arabian regime in order to establish that sunni israeli alliance that iran had so desperately attempted to forstall with the october 7th attacks in the first place and all joe biden has to do is shut the hell up that 's all he has to do all joe biden has to do is recognize the reality hamas is an iranian backed terror group when you force israel to not do things to protect itself even in the most immediate sense well hamas is re ing hostage deals by the way iran is is currently rejecting hostage deals they literally did this over the weekend on saturday they rejected the latest attempt to exchange hundreds of terrorists in favor of hostages claiming that israel should completely pull out of the gaza strip which of course is not going to happen the only further step that israel could take here and they should take it right now while the iron is hot while the rest of the world sees what iran is and what its proxies are israel should finish off its business in rafa finished the war move to low - level cleanup operations and counterinsurgency operations in the gaza strip and then turn and make a deal with the saudis to box in the iranians i have a feeling that 's exactly what israel is going to do the reason being if israel is unwilling to take a serious swipe at the iranian regime by completely destroying its oil refineries and its nuclear facilities if israel is not willing to do that a pinpoint hit the camel in the ass attack is not going to serve israel any purpose it does nothing all it does is tick off joe biden and the white house if israel is unwilling to go to fullscale war with hisbah and finish it off right now because they are afraid that joe biden will not provide the support necessary for that militarily not in terms of direct american strikes but in terms of the sort of offensive aid necessary for israel to finish off in the north then there 's no point in doing it in other words go big or go home and the last aspect of go big for israel is finish off the gaza strip solidify that position militarily and then turn to the north with presumably some foreign aid so this of course the latest attack on israel underscores the fact that the united states does in fact have a significant geopolitical interest in granting israel the capacity to militarily defend itself and yes to viate threats from abroad that is a good thing for the united states because american allies that are turned weak force the united states to stand in directly that 's actually the of american foreign policy in the post world war ii era it turns out that when america 's allies are strong and can defend themselves the united states is less required to do things when american allies are weak and can not defend themselves the united states is forced to provide things like a nuclear umbrella in europe the reason that happened is because the united states in 1956 during the suz canal crisis took the opposite side from america 's own allies thus undermining their credibility on the world stage and that in turn force the united states to take more of a leading role in europe so if you do not like america taking leading roles what you need to do is strengthen american allies to the extent that they can defend themselves and this of course is precisely what various republicans were saying over the weekend so for example steve scis who 's the house majority whip he put out a tweet suggesting that it was time to pass it he said in light of iran 's unjustified attack on israel the house will move from its previously announced legislative schedule next week to instead consider legislation that supports our ally israel and holds iran and its terrorist proxies accountable the house of representativ stand strongly with israel there must be consequences for this unprovoked attack more details on the legislative items to be considered will be forthcoming lindsey graham is saying the same thing so the question becomes what exactly that foreign aid looks like because obviously the question about foreign aid at this point is whether it 's a giant foreign aid bill that also includes ukraine whether it 's an israel stands alone bill or anything else and that 's going to be the calculation for the house this week are they looking for israel for aid alone or are they looking for aid for israel with regard to ukraine get to more on this in a moment first the people of israel are once again under attack over the week the islamic republic of iran launched a wave of suicide drones followed by ballistic and cruise missiles at israel the situation in northern israel has been tens for months tens of thousands of people are not living in their homes thanks to a ron back kah terrorists operating out of lebanon now the situation is coming to aead israel needs your prayers and your support now more than ever the entry of iran into the war is a serious development it means israel could be fighting with kamas terrorist in the south iran backb in the north and iran itself which has military capabilities beyond either kamas orah the international fellowship of christians and jews has been been responding to israel 's emergency needs during the war by supplying protective gear for first responders emergency supply kits bomb shelters reinforced ambulances and other critical needs in northern israel they are on the ground right now preparing to protect civilian populations with mobile bomb shelters food and other basic necessities,1.2713,but what i find interesting about her take is that although it 's critical of men who are concerned about mentoring women she actually points out that in her experience most men have been good to her so if her experience has been overwhelmingly positive well of course she will take the approach that this story is utter nonsense but there are a lot of men who are concerned and the spectator brings up a really good point as to why in a story from yesterday seemingly in response to the store from near times me to has hurt women in the workplace daniela greenbaum writes there are two large problems both of which play a role in contributing to this new workplace reality the first is that unwittingly or not me too has placed sexual assault and sexual harassment on the same platform both are wrong and women should never be subject to either whether in the workplace or anywhere else but anyone who has experienced sexual assault or even has a friend or colleague who has experienced sexual assaults can attest to the fact that there is a world of difference between harassment and assault the second problem is that the movement has championed this notion that society must believe all women the issue here is that america 's justice system treats the accused as innocent until proven guilty yet society has come to treat accusations as if they were fact that gives men the impression that with a single tweet a single sentence a single comment we are able to destroy their lives some women i know cherish that sense of power they argue that since men are physically stronger and with centuries of history in which women were oppressed and not treated as equals it 's good to instill a little fear in the other sex i do not believe they anticipated the extent to which fear is a highly motivating factor this time it has motivated men to mentor fewer women how that 's a victory for my fellow females i do not have a clue daniela brings up a really great point if the idea is believe all women then in this societal function you are not innocent until proven guilty you are guilty period if a woman just says so now in response to this kind of christen there 's been a lot of women who say yes but false accusations are extremely rare they do not happen but they do happen enough and that 's going to freak people out whether you want to accept it or not a while ago we heard about something called the shitty men and media lists where women anonymously made accusations against men and in some instances men came out and said these are false accusations but it do not matter their lives had been damaged because some women anonymously on the internet accused them this story from october of last year a writer named on the shitty media men list is suing its creator steven elliot claiming defamation seeks 1.5 million and plans to identify anonymous women who alleged sexual misconduct elliot has aligned himself with the attorney andrew miltenberg a lawyer who specializes in fighting sexual assault claims and who has raised concern over title 9 protections miltenberg made a name for himself representing 100 of male college students accused of assault challenging what he has told reporters is a system that is unfair to men the story is a few months old but i think you can see why many men are going to react this way it may be that instances like the shitty media men list is it 's extremely rare and men have nothing to worry about but this story got a lot of attention it was a media story so female writers and personalities were propagating it and if people hear about it well the squeaky wheel gets the grease i assure you they are going to be very powerful high - powered and successful men who are going to say look i do not want to end up in one of these situations so do not bother sending that email do not bother sending that message and do not go into private meetings with women because it could only take one word or one miscommunication think about it this way there 's a lot of women who say just do not harass women sure but in today 's day and age people are overly sensitive and what if a guy does something that is normal male behavior that women do not like i will give you an example if a man says to another man you look stunning that 's an incredible suit where 'd you get it the guy 's going to be like i am my tailor is so - and - so over on fifth avenue that 's totally fine and acceptable in almost every circumstance but if a man says to a woman whoa you look stunning that suit is incredible where did you get that made she might take that a different way and say why is this man commenting on my appearance there are different societal expectations and a lot of men who might act one way in the workplace for everybody could be seen as creepy or another example imagine if a guy met another guy and grabbed his shoulder while talking to him about a story guys do that kind of thing fairly often making physical contact is not typically a sexual thing but imagine if a male colleague was mentoring women and he put his hand on his shoulder she might be like why is this guy touching me men and women have different expectations because they are different and it 's because of simple things like that you are going to find a lot of guys we are going to say listen i can pat my buddy on the back with no problems i can not touch this woman there are different standards that are being applied and then you are going to find that guys can not treat women the same way they treat male mentees or colleagues thus regardless of whether or not men want to mentor win or they do not there are different behaviors they have to apply and they do not know all the rules all that means is guys are going to say listen i do not know what is or is not acceptable it 's not about harassment,0.4347,but you need a dailywire plus membership to watch join right now at dailywire.com subscribe use code dei for 35 % off your new membership do not miss out all righty so the state of the race you need to explain the state of the race because otherwise the october surprise does not make a lot of sense the state of the race is that donald trump appears to be ahead going into the home stretch in fact po analyst reporter mark halperin yesterday said as much he said that if the early voting numbers hold up the way they are right now and if the same day voting the day of voting goes the way that it did in 2020 donald trump will have wrapped up this election before the election day even begins because basically democrats need to win it in the pregame or they are going to lose it day of here 's hel explaining just yesterday morning everybody let us lead with the lead as they say in journalism if the early vote numbers stay the way they are and that 's a big if we will almost certainly know before election day who 's going to win the election we are going to talk a lot about that the reasons why democrats might be underperforming the prospect that they will recover but again make no mistake if these numbers hold up in the states where we can understand even partially what the data is like we will know that donald trump is going to be president on election day and hper is not the only one saying this the washington post reported yesterday dozens of states have opened inperson early voting locations turnout has been robust in georgia more than 1.6 million people had cast inperson ballots by midm morning on tuesday nearly 13d of the total vote from four years ago north carolina hit 1.4 million on tuesday the sixth day of early voting in nevada republicans voting in person have outnumbered democrats which is an amazing reversal from four years ago nationwide over 18 million americans have already ballots in person or by mail republican participation is radically up from where it was in 2020 when donald trump encouraged people not to vote early now tons of republicans are voting early and what that means that in states like nevada there are serious danger signs for democrats according to john ralston of the nevada independent he 's an excellent reporter over there breitbart reports this he 's been reporting the early vote numbers showing a gop lead and flashed the warning to democrats late monday evening out west ralson noted that since the rise of the political machine that late former senate majority leader harry reed built for democrats this has never happened the republicans have amount what amounts have opened what amounts to an unprecedented in modern times lead in early voting over democrats in nevada so kamla harris is running really really weak in the early voting thus far now again it could be that that 's cannibalizing the day of voting it 's possible that the people who are voting right now are people who would have voted election day normally or it 's possible that republicans have actually gotten smart and many of the people who were not going to show up on election day are now voting early just to get it done by the way if you are voting early that is a good thing voting early is good because the party for what you are voting can see that you have voted they do not have to waste campaign resources going to your door and door knocking you if they already know that you have voted a senior official working on harris 's campaign is already sounding the alarm about the vep 's narrowing electoral path according to nbc news three sources with knowledge of the campaign strategy say the campaign is worried the blue wall could at least in part go red this november one senior campaign official told nbc there 's been a thought that maybe m michigan or wisconsin will fall off and added that north carolina may no longer be in reach okay if they lose north carolina and they lose say michigan or wisconsin very difficult to see how the democrats win the election because they would have to at that point peel off georgia and georgia looks like it is moving steadily toward donald trump in this electoral cycle politico saying the same thing they are pointing out that the time is ticking off the clock for kamla harris quote vice president tom harris and former wyoming representative liz cheney descended on the crucial milwaukee suburbs monday night and sitting side by side delivered compelling political sermons the problem was they were preaching to the converted the event was explicitly aimed at moderates and onetime republicans who remain up for grabs and made decide the election but the re the rhetoric seemed better suited for those in the audience wearing lincoln project and kamala t - shirts,0.3881,so i suppose one among many and i do not imagine it will be the last word on that front it 's not designed to be a propaganda tool it 's designed to be a an invitation let us say and so onward with it a conservative manifesto introduction a profound crisis of meaning currently afflicts destabilizes and demoralizes the sovereign citizens of the west and the social institutions upon which we depend that crisis has increasingly spread to the remainder of the world 's people generating confusion and sowing distrust producing a counterproductive discord in place of the peaceful voluntary cooperation and competition that could instead reign over and unite us that crisis is in the first place the consequence of a corrosive doubt sold not least by the careless intellect regarding the value of the principles of value aim in action that have heretofore inspired guided and stabilized us that crisis is in the second place the consequence of the historically unprecedented realization of our ignorance about the ultimate source nature and reality of those principles and our resultant inability to formulate and communicate a clear moral justification for their existence that crisis is in the third place the consequence of the presumptuous premature and finally narrowly self - serving insistence arising from that doubt and ignorance that nothing but the will to power the willingness and desire to dominate and exploit motivates all individual perceptions and actions and gives rise to and maintains all social institutions that crisis is finally use of the frustration and resentment that necessarily arises when doubt ignorance and intellectual pride combine to demonize divide and exploit to insist upon an impossible and final conceptual certitude and to demand recognition of a false and unearned moral virtue that crisis itself in the idolatrous battles simultaneously petty and terrible that currently divide our world in the disputes about identity that lead astray and render hopeless in the stoking of suspicion between men and women in the insistence that enmity must divide black brown and white in the subjugation of the education that should enlighten to the ideologies that possess in the cycle of accusation that threatens the trust upon which peace and prosperity necessarily depends and in the panicked anti - human apocalyptic doom saying that undermines the spirit of our sons and daughters what can those of us who attempt to abide by and manifest a courageous faith in the traditional values of our past offer in such times not the thoughtless and instrumental appeal to cynicism and bitterness associated with the insistence that our social and political institutions are fundamentally unreliable corrupt and untrustworthy not the harsh and condemnatory exhortation or demand to accept and uphold a moral code noteworthy only for its joylessness sterility and tendency to forbid and damn instead the confident and forthright transmission of the abandoned eternal verities to all of those who currently wander thirst and starve in their absence what are the values of paramount importance to the conservative temperament currently crying out for rediscovery reconsideration and discussion an inevitably incomplete but crucially necessary list might include humility liberty autonomy truth agency identity merit responsibility tradition community stewardship justice and unity to that list might be profitably appended a set of propositions about the true nature and source of absolute privation the inevitability of economic inequality and the practical realities of the individual competence upon which psychological integrity and social contract equally and mutually depend humility humility is the opposite of the prideful authoritarian arrogance that insists upon the possession of comprehensive and final skill and knowledge to revere humility is to accept the insufficiency of current presumption to acknowledge the value of attending to what is not yet known to listen to value and attempt to truly understand the opinions of others no matter how ill - formed to strive to gain further knowledge and to convince and invite instead of insisting and compelling humility is therefore a fundamental precondition for learning for the revivifying meaningful engagement that learning produces and for the maintenance and renovation of what has already been validly learned established and universally valued liberty liberty is valuable not because it enables the hedonism that heedlessly sacrifices the future and the community to the narrowly conceptualized present and the impulsive needs and wants of the individual liberty is valuable because it allows all free and unique people the opportunity to best confront the potential of the future to engage in the voluntary productive reciprocal interactions that make peaceful mutually sustaining social life possible to speak the truth that redeems and renews and to adopt the responsibility of citizenship and ethical endeavor liberty enables people to think authentically and without arbitrary constraints privately and publicly liberty allows people to employ that unconstrained authentic thought to imagine a diverse set of possibilities to singly and jointly assess criticize prioritize and improve them and to choose from those diverse criticized and improved possibilities the most evidently valuable compelling path forward autonomy the emergent problems that constantly beset us and simultaneously offer new opportunities can only be addressed by the continual provision of equally unpredictable and variable sets of solutions such provision is best insured by valuing and encouraging development of the widest possible range of productive activities and enterprises from which variation might be drawn the most appropriate solutions autonomous citizens can bring the individual differences of their temperament experience and skill to bear on the problem of adaptation itself autonomous people and institutions as widely distributed as possible are free to vary in their response to the particularized demands of their local environments from that variant pool all individuals free to communicate and assess can derive the solutions most apt and efficiently match to their current situations and problems widely distributed autonomous local activities allow for the establishment of resilient large - scale unified systems optimally resistant to the rapid and dangerous spread of any given unpredictable emergent problem optimally able to respond with timely and particularized solutions the principle of autonomy therefore enables abundant provision in relation to the necessities and luxuries of life maximal choice regarding the manner in which that provision will occur and diverse opportunities for meaningful sustaining engagement in the voluntary productive and sustainable private and social endeavors that best produce abundance and choice free markets best fulfill the need for autonomy local activity and wide distribution their superiority to all other known and likely possible systems given that fulfillment should be unapologetically recognized and promoted by those dedicated to the canonical values of the west no other systems allow for the crucial and ever - changing decisions about what is currently valuable to be made by the uncompelled choice and voluntary endeavor of the widest possible number of people no other systems allow for the sampling and aggregation of the myriad of widely varying and particularized thoughts and decisions constituted by that free choice and voluntary endeavor no other system therefore does or apparently can operate in the manner that makes continued adaptation to the unpredictable horizon of the future both possible and desirable truth the future genuinely and unpredictably differs from the past in consequence a continual array of complex and unforeseen problems present themselves before us demanding redress a diverse honest and freely exchanged range of thoughts pertaining to those problems is the eternal precondition for the possibility of solution itself as well as for its dissemination there are many valid productive and attractive ways of looking at and acting in the world and a variety of perspectives is simultaneously necessary strategically appropriate and inevitable it is also forever the case however that discipline striving in a single direction fortifies and unifies that an ethic capable of uniting diverse citizens in trust and peace is necessary and desirable and the truth itself is never to be finally found in a particular set of facts or body of knowledge the genuine striving forward ethically instead is the very embodiment of truth and therefore the most valid manifestation of truth itself the humble attempt to advance ourselves and others through discourse as a consequence of listening and spontaneous response is instead the very embodiment of truth the willingness to reach in good faith across the divides of race sex economic class and political temperament is instead the very embodiment of truth the divisive insistence on the absolute relativity of truth can be combated not least with the realization that truth is a process not a state the realization finally that the adventure of life is to be found precisely in pursuit of the truth constitutes the only real antidote to the corrosive nihilism that justifies deception hopelessness cynicism and abdication of responsibility the most fundamental freedoms upon which virtuous states and polities depend freedom of speech and thought foremost above them exist not for the impulsive gratification of momentary pleasures but so that the truth that redeems find its living expression agency the insistence that we are almost appropriately conceptualized at the level of the group whether by sexual preference race gender political belief or ethnicity provides the counter opportunity for conservatives to re - establish and reinforce the bedrock notion and principle of the sovereignty of the individual which attributes to each person the capacity to advance and progress in the face of uncertainty malevolence and adversity those with truly canonical western views can as well oppose the demoralizing notions of the essential corruption of all human activity and its putative basis in nothing but oppression and compulsion with the knowledge that the desire to strive forward is in its essential form a manifestation of the spirit of voluntary cooperation the desire for productive reciprocal social interaction and the reality of genuine good will the ambition that overcomes privation and penury the urge to adventure toward greatness the desire to marry the wish to have a family the willingness to shoulder responsibility all this is truly and genuinely admirable and worthy of recognition and reward all this constitutes the basis of any truly stable and desirable state psychological and social alike with attendant duties voluntarily undertaken and attendant rewards validly earned and distributed all this is furthermore the most reliable basis for any true sustainability identity a sophisticated and adaptive identity is in no wise established through the mere insistence that a felt sense of subjective feeling must dominate and,0.3257,no he do not die yet jesus have not died so he do not he could not have died for the man on the cross jesus had not died when you have a sacrifice if you take the second face just the sacrifice sitting on an altar that it was not sacrificed you have to kill the sacrifice and all of the above before it is considered a sacrifice before jesus died none of the covenant was applicable to us none of it these people were subject under john 's repentance now god gave jesus the power to forgive on earth if some of you guys i do not know if you realize that jesus can forgive of sins on earth so why jesus was on the cross before the death burial resurrection of christ he forgave the man on the cross of his sins that has nothing to do with his death burial resurrection once jesus was was resurrected then the prophecy was completed that the lamb was sacrificed and was resurrected and now that the land and sacrifice is resurrected everybody on earth after the resurrection is in a new covenant with god according to the scripture so now everybody after jesus 's resurrection must be baptized and filled with the holy spirit that 's why all of his apostles were baptized all of his apostles were filled with the holy spirit at the day of pentecost the thief on the cross is not you the lamb of god had not been slain before the thief foot across died jesus was still talking to him and the man on the other side they were mocking jesus actually and in this guy he said you would have a place with me in paradise it 's reasonable that jesus forgave them with the sins right there but all of those people was under john 's repentance but jesus had to pet the billeting forgive on earth you forgave that man that has nothing to do with jesus death burial resurrection i want people to see that very clearly that is a different dispossession of time anyway think about this because the man on the crowds get the holy spirit no he could not because jesus have not gone enough to send down the holy spirit so the man on the cross was never got the holy spirit nobody before that ever received the holy spirit they do not so as the people across the subject to the holy spirit the bible says that the holy spirit is the seal the bible says the holy spirit is the seal that seals your salvation so when jesus have not sent the holy spirit the man on the cross do not get the holy spirit either he died without the baptism of the holy spirit,0.5206,so bernie is clearly the front - runner and democrats instead of realizing that this is crisis point that we have now reached crisis point that bernie sanders who as i say is a lifelong ward of the state i mean the man has never held an actual job in his entire life and he is as old as my grandparents would be okay really that that it 's amazing he is a welfare queen bernie sanders bernie sanders has been living off the taxpayer dime by the way every job his wife has ever held is is adjacent to his government service and as we will see that has some pretty ugly ramifications that guy is leading the race right now he 's a clear lead in all of the national polling all of it there 's another poll today showing him up past 30 percent so he is picking up support as biden fails and as it becomes clear to democrats that bernie is the most likely nominee they are convincing himself that he has the capacity to win over 70 % of democrats believe that bernie sanders can beat president trump he now has in the realclearpolitics polling average an 11 point lead on the rest of the democratic field the polling in nevada is solidly behind sanders in south carolina the latest poll has joe biden and bernie sanders tied which is a disaster area for joe biden because if he loses south carolina he is toast at that point there is a poll in california that shows bernie sanders up heavy in california as well a lot of the polls where where biden is the placeholder biden is is likely to flail out there are two late - breaking polls from california one shows bernie all the way up at 32 % with the next closest competitor biden all the way down at 14 another poll shows by shows bernie at 25 % in bloomberg at 21 we will get to bloomberg as i say in just a second but bernie is the front - runner okay and bernie is he should again he scares me not because i think that he is a tremendously capable politician i do not but because what 's going on right now is such frustration inside the democratic party at the reality that donald trump is president that they will vote for a communist to stop donald trump this is where we are and then now bloomberg i mean sanders for his part is going after bloomberg but here 's the thing about bernie bernie is supremely dishonest in many ways bernie is supremely dishonest he 's honest when he says that he 's a socialist who does not know how to pay for his plans that part 's real but he 's dishonest when he says that he is clean as the driven snow and pure as the driven snow i will give you an example,0.8142,trump said he might take up house speaker nancy pelosi on a suggestion she made over the weekend trump also claimed the rules of the inquiry had been rigged by pelosi and house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff apparently democrats are seeking to prove that trump leveraged military assistance apparently senator ron johnson also said that the whistleblower source is exposed to things that do not need to be exposed from the white house national security official told house investigators that gordon sunland was acting at behest so it 's going to be a spicy week for the trump administration meanwhile the the and as i say sunland is going to be the key witness here because none of the other people who were in the room with trump are slated to testify at this point meaning john bolton is not slated to testify at this point despite the fact that bolton and trump apparently met privately over the withheld aid according to testimony from one of these white house officials timothy morrison who is an aide to the state department he said the extent of my recollection is that ambassador bolton simply said he was not ready to do it as far as holding up the aide now whether bolton testifies or not is still up in the air sunland however is booked he has already testified behind closed doors and so a lot is going to come down to gordon sunland meanwhile president trump is very angry at mike pompeo apparently he 's raging at my pompeo because members of the state department have come for and testified against trump well pompeo can not control that i mean it 's not up to pompeo whether members of the state department testify presumably he 's already told people he does not want them to testify trump has already said that obviously according to nbc news trump is fumed for weeks the pompeo is responsible for hiring state department officials whose congressional testimony threatens to bring down his presidency the president confronted pompeo about the officials during lunch at the white house october 29th those familiar with the matter said inside the white house the view is that trump just felt like ranier people in apparently trump particularly blames pompeo for tapping a bill taylor in june to be the top us diplomat in ukraine but then again in june pompeyo do not realize that trump was going to just radically change ukraine policy and decide that who 's going to withhold the ukrainian aid so as i said all along there are open questions in all of this the problem is that everything is so partisan and so polarized at this point that nobody takes it seriously and frankly i am not sure that they should because it is so partisan and so polarized okay with all of that said the foreign scene continues to be incredibly chaotic over in iran protests have reached a hundred cities according to the associated press in iran supreme leader on sunday cautiously backed the government 's decision to raise gasoline prices by 50 percent after days of widespread protests calling those who attack public property during demonstrations thugs signaling a potential crackdown loom the government has shut down internet access across the nation to stanch demonstrations that took place in reported 100 cities and towns images published by state and semi official media showed the scale of the damage and images of burned gas stations and banks torched vehicles and roadways littered with debris there have been accusations that iran is using deadly force on protesters iranian authorities on sunday raised the official death toll in the violence to at least three attackers targeting a police station in the western city of kermanshah on saturday killed an officer according to the state - run irn a news agency lawmaker said another person was killed in a suburb of tehran ayatollah ali khamenei said some lost their lives some places were destroyed without elaborating so people have been ignoring in the media the fact they are roiling protests against the iranian government that 's been ongoing for literally years at this point which is good news for the west you know wildly while the europeans are ripping president from for the sanctions while the press is ripping from for the sanctions the fact is that this is significantly curtailed 2 - runs ability to control even its own country and it is cut down on iran 's ability to fund terror abroad it is amusing i will say for the new york times to report that tehran has maximized its power in iraq at the same time the new york times has been militating in favor of giving billions of dollars to tehran in cash according to the new york times big story in the new york times over the weekend hundreds of leaked intelligence reports shed light on a shadow war for regional influence apparently iran has been exerting its influence in rock which of course everybody knew i mean the fact is that iran has intervened in iraq so much that hundreds if not thousands of american troops died at the behest of ronnie and militias throughout the iraq war according to the new york times in mid - october with the unrest swirling in baghdad a familiar visitor swift slipped quietly into the iraqi capital the city had been under siege for weeks as protesters marched in the streets demanding an end to corruption and calling for the ouster of the prime minister adil absolu mahdi in particular they denounced the outsized influence of their neighbor iran on iraqi politics burning iranian flags attacking an iranian consulate the visitor was there to restore order but his presence highlighted the protesters biggest grievance whose major general kasim salima sulemani head of iran 's powerful codes force he had come to persuade an ally in the iraqi parliament to help the prime minister hold on to his job sulemani is basically backing the shadow government in iraq they the same democrats who are proclaiming the trump has been too soft in his foreign - policy our simultaneously attempting to cut a deal with the iranians they can continue to maximize their power in syria in lebanon in iraq in kumasi stan according to one of the leads iranian intelligence cables mahdi who next i will work closely with iran well saddam hussein was in power in rock had a special relationship with the islamic republican republic of iran when he was rocks oil minister in 2014 the exact nature of that relationship is not detailed in the cable and has one former senior us official caution a special relationship could mean a lot of things it does not mean he 's an agent of the iranian government but no araki politician can become prime minister without iran 's blessing so there is something again if you are talking about the partisan politics that play into the impeachment inquiry there is something to the republican complaint that democrats are deeply worried about trump violating the protocols of international diplomacy by creating unofficial channels while at the same time the media cheered on the barack obama state department and the national security council being led by ben rhodes was best known for writing crap novels that were not but never published into brooklyn apartments before cutting in iran zia lines the american people while doing so it 's a dangerous world out there and the fact is that the trump administration has been a lot harsher on america 's foreign policy adversaries than the obama administration ever was so there 's a great irony to this whole idea that trump has somehow undermined american foreign policy in dramatic ways while democrats continue to try to undermine america 's foreign policy in dramatic ways another example of this hong kong is now the subject of a massive crackdown according to the according to tns news hong kong police and protesters hardened their battle lines over the weekend as violent clashes showed no signs of abating leaving the city bracing for a second week of upheaval that risks disrupting pending elections the weekend saw pitched battles with demonstrators launching bricks and molotov cocktails and steel balls of police who in turn volley teargas and deployed water cannons a police media liaison officer was hit in the leg by an arrow while protesters tossed petrol bombs at residence clearing streets strewn with bricks police were preparing to clear the remaining demonstrators from hong kong 's polytechnic university early on monday morning warned they could use live ammunition if they faced violence soldiers from the china 's people 's liberation army the pla took the rare step of leaving their barracks to join cleanup efforts which added to concern by some about china 's growing roll over the former british colony that has fuelled five months of protests so china is again trying to strengthen its grip on hong kong iran is trying to strengthen its grip on lebanon syria and iraq and we are being told that the solution to this is democratic policy and the trump has undermined american foreign policy who do you think was appeasing china for years on end both administration 's intel donald trump who do you think was appeasing iran for years on end that would have been the obama administration before trump got there who is appeasing venezuela for years on end it was the obama administration and the same democrats complaining that trump is undermined american foreign policy by setting up unofficial channels in ukraine they do not seem to give a damn that venezuela has turned into an absolute hellhole at the behest of socialists and that socialists in the united states like bernie sanders and ilhan omar continued to provide a certain level of intellectual aid and support to the dictatorial government of venezuela over the weekend supporters of juan y doe staged their biggest protest in caracas in months as venezuela z ' opposition leader seeks to revive his campaign to oust president nicolas maduro according bloomberg when week after majora 's ally evo morales was topped in bolivia cueto is seeking to boost thinning crowds that have grown apathetic since a botched uprising in april failed to remove maduro venezuela has been relatively quiet as quiet a lost momentum while violent protests rack 's latin american countries from ecuador to chile he drew crowds of hundreds of thousands this year but many followers now doubt he can unseat maduro quite owes approval rating is down to 42 % down from more than 60 % so maduro has re solidified his grip and it does not help that you have politicians of the left in the united states who continue to suggest that american involvement in venezuela not in terms of military involvement but undercover involvement support for the opposition that that is in and of itself offensive again all of this plays into how people think about impeachment so impeachment typically should all be about the actions of the president and did they violate his constitutional duties but when people see impeachment what they really see just like they have with every poll question for years they see a proxy for the broader culture war ranging from foreign policy to domestic policy from colin kaepernick and chick - fil - a to venezuela and hong kong everything is wrapped up into a ball and that is how people think of politics in the united states and i do not think that they are wrong to do so frankly because the fact is that we do not agree on enough for us to simply focus in on what the president has done right and what he 's done wrong if there was some sort of broad agreement about what american foreign policy should be if we agreed about that sort of thing or if there a broad agreement about what american freedom looked like then the role of the president himself like as a person would not matter so much right then we could all argue in favor of the idea the president ought to go based on what the president is doing or he got to stay based on what the president has done but when impeachment is just a proxy for how much you hate the president or hate his policies when you disagree with the president and therefore you want him out and even wanted that since day one it makes it very difficult to take the entire impeachment inquiry particularly seriously so that is where things stand as we enter week two of the democrat impeachment inquiry again the only testimony that 's going to matter this week you are going to see a lot of headlines that do not make any difference the only testimony that matters this week is the testimony of gordon sunland the eu ambassador who is the only person who 's been in the room with trump who will have testified at this point in time as they as push comes to shove on wednesday okay time for a quick thing that i like and then a quick thing that i hate and we will get out of here so things that i like so there is a very good movie it 's it 's about the,0.3294,so i can get the full page number here the descent goes i kid you not this is one of the longest sentence i have ever seen in my entire life this descent goes for 66 pages 66 pages and the entire descent can be summed up in a single sentence we like row rows should be upheld there 's no legal reasoning there 's no attempt at legal reasoning there is just abortion is really really important and we really really like abortion and because we really really like abortion we should uphold roe and any interest that the state has in preserving fetal life goes completely by the way side because after all we really really really like abortion which is the extent of rho in the first place row and casey they make a right out of thin air but they do not really provide any legal reasoning the descent has the same thing here so now we are going to go through the descent and it shows you how close we came in the united states you know if hillary clinton had become president of the united states if that had happened then the constituent the the constitution of the court i mean the number of people on the court the people who are on the court all of that would have been very very different you would have had a majority presumably to write into law any policy preference the left wishes including all of the insane nonsense that they are currently pushing to fight freedom of religion freedom of speech you would have basic notions of male and female obliterated by the supreme court completely that is how close we came that 's how close we came so if there is one legacy that president trump has left us in it honestly it 's astonishing that president trump has not spent every waking moment since leaving office talking about this especially since the release of that early leaked opinion talking about how this is his great victory instead of jabbering about 2020 in the election the the great good that trump did in the end was the nomination of justices gorsuch and kavanaugh and amy coney barrett because without those nominations this does not happen this is a five four and one concurrence five three and one concurrence decision and if forced to it it is highly doubtful that roberts if there have been say if inman split 4 - 4 it is very doubtful that that robbers would have provided the vote if given the choice between striking down the mississippi law and striking down roe and upholding the mississippi law and striking down row i have very little doubt that justice roberts without any sort of margin for error would have gone on the right side on this one row would still be law in the united states among other various and sundry insane provisions so says the descents in this case written by briar sotomayor and kagan for half a century roe and casey have protected the liberty and equality of women i mean right off the bat the liberty and equality of women and no conception of of the importance of fetal life no balancing tests nothing we like abortion roe held in case you reaffirmed that the constitution safeguards a woman 's right to decide for herself whether to bear a child roe held in case he reaffirmed in the first stages of pregnancy the government could not make that choice for women the government could not control a woman 's body or the course of a woman 's life it could not determine what a future what a woman 's future would be respecting a woman as an autonomous being granting her full equality meant giving her substantial choice over this most personal and most consequential of all life decisions this is a policy argument there is no constitutional argument here there 's nothing about the law this is simply we like abortion ra rob that 's what the dissent is for 60 pages it 's we love abortion row and casey well understood the difficult and divisiveness of the abortion issue the court knew americans hold profoundly differing views about the morality of terminating a pregnancy even the court recognized that the state has legitimate interest from the outset of the pregnancy and protecting the life of the fetus so the court struck a balance as it often does when values and goals compete it held that the state could prohibit abortions after fetal viability so long as the ban contained exceptions to safeguards a woman 's life or health which by the way safeguards to to allow for women 's life or health those are broad enough to encompass all abortions effectively speaking it held that even before viability the state could regulate abortion in multiple and meaningful ways but until the viability line was crossed the court held a state could not impose a substantial obstacle on a woman 's right to elect the procedure thought proper in light of all the circumstances and complexities of her own life today the court discards that balance but there was no real balance according to the dissent in the descent does not even take the row in casey line which is that they are important competing decisions they kind of pay lip service to it what they really mean is that the only real interest here is that a woman has a right to terminate her pregnancy because the argument they make in the first paragraph about a woman 's right to decide her future bodily autism these are all arguments that extend all the way up to a point of birth there 's no reason to have a balancing test and there 's no reason for these justices to administer a balancing test according to their own logic here today says the dissent the court discards that balance it says from the very moments of fertilization a woman has no rights to speak of no that is not what the court says the court says that from the moment of fertilization from the moment of conception there is now a balancing test that states administer that states get to decide that people get to vote on that 's what the court says maybe there 's a right maybe there 's not a right but the right is not constitutionally guaranteed that is what they say a state can force her to bring a pregnancy to term even at the steepest personal and familial costs again like the question here always and forever for the left is who 's going to make this call they say we should prior so to mayor kagan the rest of the left they say it should be a bunch of supreme court justices unless they are supreme court justices we do not like so we should make a decision for everyone it should not be voted on states should not have a say locality should not have a say no one should have a say except the people we agree with based on the constitution of course which they do not even cite wants to we are fully several paragraphs in there 's not a citation to the constitution,1.0654,and then if you are vladimir putin there 's actually too much attention on you right now you are going to wait for a little while and then three months from now you are going to do something according to the new york times it was a sign that the kremlin was still holding out the possibility it could use its troop buildup to achieve key objectives without military action the prospect for that scenario was bolstered in kiev where ukrainian president vladimir zielinski left open the possibility of dropping his country 's ambition to join nato a move that would help fulfill one of putin 's key demands at a news conference zelenski emphasized that nato membership was quote for our security but the goal of joining the alliance written into the country 's constitution but he acknowledged the difficult place the country found itself in nearly completely encircled by russian forces and with partners like the united states insisting they would not help ukraine if the russians invaded how much should ukraine go on that pat zielinski said who will support us he said the prospect of joining nato could be like a dream now what russia actually wants is for ukraine to foreclose the possibility of ever joining nato ukraine is not going to join nato in the near future there 's a possibility back in 2007 - 2008 the ukraine might join nato and then that was dropped and it really has not been brought up since ukraine has instead taken a position of strategic independence where they sort of play the west against the russians they say the russians listen any time it could theoretically attempt to join nato in order to enshrine our independent status and then they say to the west listen we really do not want the russians breathing down our necks we are really not going to attempt to join nato if you say to the russians that we are not joining nato then that 's an invitation for russia to either invade or to try to take over the government from within obviously because then you have been you have foreclosed the possibility of the west ever coming in to intervene on your behalf or even help you out in any serious way zielinski spoke alongside chancellor olaf scholz of germany the latest western leader trying to shuttle diplomacy to avert war the flurry of diplomacy came as fears of war have caused oil prices despite pushing well past 90 bucks a barrel said if russia violates the territorial integrity of ukraine again we know what to do in the event of military escalation we are ready for the very far - reaching and effective sanctions in coordination with our allies now here 's the thing about sanctions historically wildly ineffective historically all the sanctions do is actually make states in many cases more territorially aggressive because when you undermine their economy with sanctions they tend to invade surrounding countries in order to demonstrate to the domestic population that they are still very strong what what russia is attempting to do is gain enormous sway over ukraine without actually having to fire a shot and it looks like they may actually be able to do that because if ukraine drops the possibility of ever joining nato then they do not have to worry about what the west has to say about any of this lavrov said that russia had prepared a 10 - page response and it 's written back and forth with nato and the united states over the kremlin 's security demands ambiguity about what comes next has been central to putin 's strategy in the crisis set off by his troop buildup now there was this weird situation over the last 24 hours in which zelenski suggested that there would be invasion as of wednesday that he had suggested that february 16th will be the day of the attack on ukraine by russia but that was walk back yesterday the presidential advisor michael podeliak said zelenski was not being literal when he said the attack would be on wednesday but was being ironic um i am not sure why that 's that 's kind of weird that 's an odd thing zolenski wrote that the ukrainian government was told wednesday would be the day of the attack as he announced a new decree to establish a national day of unity increased funding of military service personnel accelerate the development of defenses and create an information system to a prize citizens of the security situation now russia has been stopping some of its operations on the borders they say that they are pulling back some of their troops from around ukraine but other large - scale military drills have been continuing again in an attempt to get ukraine to offer them some sort of face saving concession or maybe a real concession defense minister sergey shoigu on monday appeared to characterize russia 's enormous troop build up around ukraine as part of large - scale drills being carried out by the military on tuesday it was said by the defense ministry spokesperson of russia igor konoshenkov that some of the troops of the southern and western military districts had completed their tasks and we are now heading back to bays russian state television aired footage of tanks being loaded onto rail cars describing it as images of troops headed back to their garrisons said a number of combat training events including exercises have been carried out according to plan as the combat training events are completed the troops as always will march in a combined way to their permanent deployment points so this means they are still pretty close to the country even if they are pulled back to base there 's no immediate confirmation from ukraine or the west that a russian pullback was in fact occurring ukraine 's foreign minister dmitry culeba said there was reason to be skeptical of moscow 's statements he says when you see the withdrawal then we will start believing in de - escalation obviously a lot of other foreign countries do not believe that the russians are fully de - escalating because russian units are apparently moving into attack positions according to a u.s official according to cbs news some russian units have left their assembly areas the bumper - to - bumper formation seen in satellite photos they are beginning to move into attack formation that movement marks a change since sunday when some of the units had left the assembly areas but had not yet taken what could be viewed as attack positions if a russian attack begins u.s knowledge of what is happening dramatically will decrease u.s will have no troops on the ground no reconnaissance planes over the air russian cyber attacks and electronic warfare will blot out communications u.s officials say that russia has 80 of the forces it needs to launch a full - scale invasion and the rest are on route there 's a lot of mixed signals that are being sent by the russians at this point it 's strategic confusion would be the best way to describe it probably john kirby the spokesperson for the pentagon he says that putin could strike with little or no warning at this point we have said for a while now that military action could happen any day and you heard from the national security advisor uh making it clear that it certainly could happen before the end of the olympics uh maybe even this week i will not get into a specific date i do not think that would be smart i would just tell you that it is entirely possible that he could move with little to no warning,0.8425,[ music ]

get the truth that the mainstream media does not want you to hear not too long ago being labeled a flip - flopper was a big deal in presidential politics whatever your policy positions might be the worst possible sin was to be indecisive about them if you remember what happened to john krey back in 2004 uh you know what i am talking about a day before his first debate with george w bush nobody was asking john krey about his position on the iraq war or his views on taxes or anything like that instead carrie was being asked about his image as a flip - flopper and he was forced to admit in an interview with the new york times that it was a major vulnerability carrie claimed that his positions had really been consistent but at the time he he also acknowledged that the bush campaign had succeeded in portraying him as indecisive and untrustworthy which in reality he actually was that 's why 60 % of voters said that carrie told people what they wanted to hear rather than what he really believed and ultimately whether you think car 's reputation for flip - flopping was deserved or not it is a big part of the reason why he lost the election 20 years later it 's now abundantly clear that the flip flopper label does not really scare democrats anymore and the corporate press is not concerned about it either in the span of just a month kla harris 's team has systematically reversed pretty much every major policy proposal she 's ever supported in her career and these changes are so significant and so completely unexplained that they would have immediately destroy kl harris 's candidacy if she were running 20 years ago but this country has changed a lot in two decades or at least the kamla harris campaign is betting that it has changed a lot hoping that it has so they are proceeding to revise her entire platform day by day for example harris 's campaign now claims that she no longer wants to ban fracking even though as recently as 2020 she said that she supported a total fracking ban as part of the green new deal the campaign also says that harris no longer supports an electric vehicle mandate even though in 20 2019 harris co - sponsored the zero emissions vehicles act and that bill would have required that 100 % of new vehicles be electric or hydrogen powered by 2040 and if any manufacturer tried to make a gas powered car after 2040 the epa could shut them down according to the text of the bill quote after model year 2040 the epa administrator may issue an injunction on the manufacturer of any passenger vehicles other than zero emission vehicles by a vehicle manufacturer but yesterday that all changed harris uh and her rapid response director sent out a so - called fact check uh email that began quote fact vice president harris does not support an electric vehicle mandate instead the email states that harris supports groundbreaking subsidies and tax credits for electric vehicles so they are in the middle of this major policy reversal one of many and they are dressing it up as a fact check they are implying that you are the one who 's mistaken when really they are trying to pull a slight of hand and and they are factchecking by saying no kamla harris does not support that when that 's not the claim we know she does not support it now the claim is that a few years ago she did but their fact check does not mention that and there are other reversals too on everything from abolishing private health insurance to closing immigrant detention centers to defunding the police and so on and so on uh harris 's campaign has offered no explanation for these changes but everybody knows what the explanation is she wants to win the election and she understands that california leftism is not popular outside of california she does not have principles she only has internal polling and apparently uh the internal polling on all these left - wing policies is not looking very good now to that end the k harris campaign has just announced by far its most dramatic policy reversal yet contrary to everything harris has said for the past five years her campaign has just come out in support of donald trump 's border wall,0.5608,youtube they will censor you but they can not they are not censoring you at the you know http layer smtp layer these are layers that are uh more open they are open source software basically bitcoin is opsource software or you could actually consider it as the latest layer of the internet protocol stack again i mentioned a couple http smtp btc would be another one but instead of just moving information you are actually able to move economic value without permission um and unlike the application layer like it 's bitcoin 's not a company so there 's no headquarters no ceo there 's no uh mark zuckerberg that 's going to censor you for sending the wrong bitcoin transaction it 's completely decentralized decentralized exactly so it 's an internet protocol infused with money so it 's like if the internet and gold had a baby that is bitcoin that 's one sort of good analogy and then the other another good one is digital gold and i think that 's useful because it points you to what is gold why did gold become money and that gets you into the properties of good money and you can see oh this is what made gold good it was divisible durable recognizable portable and scarce and then if you evaluate bitcoin through the same criteria you see that it it basically out forms gold an order of magnitude in all of those properties of money so those are a couple of good ones it 's open source software it 's money you could also say it 's a social institution or a decentralized organization i mean there there 's no one that works at bitcoin but there are millions of people that work for bitcoin right everyone that 's mining bitcoin all the entrepreneurs that are building on it um developers that are that are writing the software and updating it people that are holding it like technically you are participating the fact that you have not spent your bitcoin you are contributing to the monetization of bitcoin because you have bitcoin that you are not selling you are holding it so you have supply that 's been taken off the market and the more demand is against the supply that 's taken off the market,0.9847,i do not even consider signing it because i do not accept any amount of money to throw away my first amendment rights but i suspected what they wanted and later my suspicions turned out to be true they wanted to buy the rights to one of my previous videos where i was insulting starbucks for removing the christmas symbols from their december formerly christmas cubs when they rebranded to the more politically correct winter cubs also about five or six years ago some lawyer contacted me and wanted me to sign an nda because their client wanted to meet with me about a media company that they were starting and that 's not how i do business that seems shady to me if you are in the industry or you used to be and you want to talk you can email me or dm me on twitter i have always kept my word about things that are told to me off the record i am just a guy in my kitchen on a laptop but unlike virtually every other youtuber i do not take on advertisers shield garbage products or services for 90 seconds or two minutes per video i just sell my own books and my own t - shirts if you listen to am talk radio it 's even worse those shows are like 40 commercials and i do not want to mention any names sean hannity but the shilling is endless but fredo loves the industry and part of him launching his youtube channel is him trying to get recognized by a quote real network and aside from msnbc and the big broadcast networks abc nbc and cbs there are other options out there like newsy which is a smaller over - the - air broadcast 24 - hour network and news nation which used to be wgn america which is another 24 - hour little - known fledgling cable channel and just before i sat down to record this video news broke that that is fredo 's new home news nation cable channel that virtually nobody has heard of because they get literally less than 50 000 viewers i want to help i want to find a way to help people i am going to come to this nation and i want to build something special here work with dan work with the team here they have got great people who are really hungry to make a difference in ways that i think matter i had decided that i can not go back uh to what people see as the big game i do not think i can make a difference there i think we need insurgent media i am going to do the job i am going to go where the news is and i am going to try very hard to be fair and i want to do it here i want to make a difference and i am really hoping that it makes a difference for you and i thank news nation very much for the opportunity ashley banfield who used to work for msnbc years ago has a show there dan abrams who used to be a legal analyst for abc news is there a guy named leland vitter who used to work for fox news has show over there and now fredo is the face of news nation he probably signed like a three or six month deal with them and they are hoping that having the former face of cnn prime time join them will finally put them on the map but instead of mocking fredo for joining a cable channel that has literally less than a quarter of the viewers that i have here on youtube i am proud of him and i fully support him and wish him all the success in the world because if he can siphon off a few more thousand viewers from cnn then maybe that ship will finally sink being a media analyst i have known that news nation existed but i have never mentioned them before because there 's never been a reason they have never done anything newsworthy they have never had any groundbreaking interviews they just sort of existed there on cable like hundreds of other channels but fredo i really do wish you the best remember newsmax was a joke for years and went along with probably 50 000 subscribers for who knows how long and i do not say that it is an insult or to disparage them i think newsmax is great but the point is that newsmax had been on cable news for years with hardly anybody noticing and then just all of a sudden blew up after fox news do not take many people 's concerns about election fraud seriously after the 2020 election and then tons of people just left fox news and then newsmax all of a sudden became a major player in the news business fredo joining news nation is making news in fact it 's the most attention that the network has ever received and like i said it 's the first time that most people have even heard that they exist,0.1916,"sorry it 's about 23 times higher my dad 's it 's not 230 times about to about 23 times higher by the by these statistics that i have seen no deaths occurred in those aged nine or younger which makes me a little suspicious of these statistics but cases in those aged 70 to 79 an 8 % fatality rate for people aged 80 years or older fatality rate of 14 point 8 percent no deaths reported among mild and severe cases but if you have a secondary condition that exacerbates it then you got a real problem on your hands if you have diabetes or cardiovascular disease or chronic respiratory disease or hypertension then this exacerbates whatever underlying condition you have and you are likely to have a higher mortality rate in the latest china based study not peer - reviewed by us scientists of course because china will not let anyone in china is a bad actor on the world stage man they are a bad actor on the world stage and it 's causing a lot of people to rethink investments in china now and in the future it found that men had a fatality rate of 2.8 % versus 1.7 percent for women probably a large part of that is due to the fact that men in china smoked at a much higher rate than women apparently about 50 % of men in china smoked and so if you have an underlying lung condition you have emphysema or something then it is more likely that you are going to die from exacerbation of that condition via coronavirus according to this jemma study there are about 82,000 cases confirmed cases of kovat 19 that 's what it 's called in at least 2768 deaths as of wednesday that is according to the johns hopkins whiting school of engineering sensors for system science and engineering they are more than 440 cases in northern italy so this has indeed become a pandemic because it is well outside of china on thursday china 's national health commission said there were 433 new confirmed cases of corona virus in 29 more deaths as of wednesday bringing the total number of cases in that country near 80 thousand the total number of deaths near 3,000 south korea has also reported 334 new cases that means that there are more than 1500 cases in south korea denmark and estonia have confirmed their first cases of the corona virus brazil confirmed its first case of corona virus late on wednesday and of course in the united states there about 80 people who have been locked down in various areas of the united states the first the first case of an american who has corona virus from an untraceable source emerged in northern california what that means that everybody else we have been able to trace to some sort of flight out of china or contact with somebody else who had corona virus the fact that we are now seeing cases that are cropping up in which people are getting it from we do not know where that 's obviously very scary one of the big problems with corona virus as opposed to for example ebola is that ebola is only transmissible once the symptoms head so once you start vomiting blood that 's when you are transmissible corona virus apparently has up to a two - week latency period where you are exhibiting no symptoms and yet you are hanging around people and you are sneezing on them and you are shaking hands with them and you can transmit the virus that means that this thing does have a very very high transmissibility right naturally stalks are continuing to tumble the virus has spread to some 4700 countries and has put pressure on business and supply chains around the world according to the new york times stock on stocks on wall street fell sharply in early trading on thursday as the sixth straight day of losses for the s&p 500 as investors continued it to react with fear to the spreading of corona virus outbreaks the selling could push major benchmarks and seen that into the united states into a correction which would indicate that an index is down more than 10 percent from its most recent high we have pushed into that territory again it is very unclear at this point how far the coronavirus crisis is going to go analysts at goldman sachs predicted that companies in the s&p 500 would generate no profit growth as a result of the crisis because of a severe klein in chinese economic activity disruption in the supply chain for american companies and a slowdown in the united states economy again this is not a specifically american problem in fact america is getting hit by coronavirus at a rate far lesser than virtually every other country but it is a problem pretty much everywhere else we have seen coronavirus crop up in dozens and dozens of countries in iran it 's hitting like every major person in the government which is pretty incredible according to an iranian official this is joyce kerim who is a who 's a reporter she is reporting on on the situation she 's in washington correspondent for the national at uae she she is reporting for iranian officials testing positive for coronavirus including the vice president for women and family affairs one lawmaker the deputy health minister and another lawmaker one iranian official says there have been 254 cases of known corona virus in iran and 26 deaths which would put their death rate at about 10 percent they have actually canceled friday prayers in iran which is a big deal in iran obviously very religiously oriented country also over in japan you have seen the government of japan ordering a closed to all schools in japan for like a month prime minister shinzo abe a was asking all elementary middle and high schools to remain shut until spring holidays begin in late march this according to the uk metro the measure affects twelve point eight million students at 35,000 schools nationwide according to the education ministry obey said the coming week or two is an extremely important time this is to prioritize the health and safety of the children and take precautions to avoid the risk of possible large - scale infections for many children and teachers who gather and spend hours together every day japan now has more than 890 cases so much more severe than the united states including 705 from that quarantined cruise ship an eighth death from the virus was confirmed thursday in japan 's northernmost island of hokkaido now considered to be the site of a growing cluster there have been a bunch of local governments who had already announced their decisions to suspend classes we have already seen outbreaks in northern italy israel has shut down travel to asia because there are a lot of asian flights that go in and out of israel israel shut down travel out of there there 's a lot of worries about permeability of borders in the middle east that if iran is is sending people across the border to a rock you could see outbreaks in iraq you see outbreaks in syria so the problem with pandemics is obviously pandemics grow in a couple of very specific situations well in general situations -",0.5944,and they will become frustrated and unruly if that egocentric play is disrupted around three this changes the properly developing child becomes able to communicate well enough to start to bring his or her own being in line with that of another one two - year - old might sit beside another play independently with his truck while his potential partner in play imagines another game with a doll now and then they might interact but without attempting to bring their mutual play worlds together two mature three - year - olds by contrast can begin to negotiate a shared play space this is the beginning both of mature identity intensely social and thoroughly negotiated in its nature and of sophisticated social being one might propose to the other you be the daddy and all be the mummy and this can be our house each can then adopt that fiction as an identity and play out

is so crucially important to children and so utterly engaging to them because it constitutes a microcosm of the expanded adult social world the child who by the age of four insists that only the identity has formulated matters and only the game that he wishes to play is to be played will find himself exceptionally unpopular with his four - year - old peers this is a complete catastrophe as the primary agents of socialization for children four years old and older are other children this means that the child who still uses the strategies of a two - year - old at the age of four particularly if those strategies involve the violence of that small percentage of two - year - olds who spontaneously manifest aggression will be unable to make friends this means further that he or she will basically be outcast alone frustrated angry and arguably worse falling further and further behind comparatively speaking with every passing month and year the aggressive two - year - old who is still kicking biting hitting stealing having temper tantrums when frustrated and is unable to adopt a negotiated identity is all too frequently a bully a narcissist a delinquent when teenaged and then later a criminal the best predictor of adolescent and adult criminal behavior is childhood conduct disorder which is characterized precisely by such attributes evident upon further exploration at a very early age identity is negotiated plain and simple not subjectively defined for all of those who have matured past the level of an egocentric and sometimes violent two - year - old and yet our society is increasingly predicated upon the insistence that such ego - centric definition of identity must be accepted at face value with all exceptions to that acceptance punishable by law there is nothing good about this for anyone the adolescents who insist that their identity be subjectively defined and who simultaneously toy with a fluid self - description even at the level of basic sex to say nothing of gender or sexual attraction appear fixated at the two - year - old level of development they are ensconced in a subjective solipsistic world of pretense which operates independently of the concerns of all others they insist with all the egocentricity of a two - year - old that their opinion about their identity regardless of whether that identity constitutes a playable social game voluntarily acceptable to others is to be regarded as paramount with all violations marked by what is essentially a temper tantrum and with all violators regardless of intent another characteristic of two - year - old thought to be punished as perpetrators why might this be well first children are now being born to adults who are old enough by historical standards to be grandparents such adults are likely to be more conservative and sheltering than younger parents they are also possessed of the resources that make optimal deprivation for their children difficult if your family is wealthy why not shield your children from all threat and pain but therefore also from all necessary challenge if your family is wealthy why not give in to every material request and fulfill every whim particularly if accompanied by an unpleasant emotional outburst easily if only temporarily quelled by parental submission second children are increasingly likely to be only children and it is highly probable that much of the basic narcissism of the two - year - old developmentally appropriate at two but not thereafter is negotiated or even pounded out by siblings who tend to be very intolerant of excess self absorption and attention seeking third parents are guilty in this atomistic protestant slash liberal sense believing at least implicitly and often explicitly that any restrictions placed on the development of their darling will interfere with his or her happiness which generally means moment - to - moment emotional stability and even worse creativity as if the relationship between constraint and creative endeavor is negative rather than positive even though the latter is clearly and demonstrably true we are also likewise increasingly required to believe and even sometimes actually believe that all social institutions are predicated upon compulsion and the arbitrary expression of power and that the relationship between the authentic and true individual and the social world is fundamentally antagonistic and something our children must be protected from if they are to develop fully this extends even to the point of skepticism about the utility and necessity of so - called competitive games as if it could be a game at all in most cases without that necessary element of competitive striving toward what is after all the point or goal of the game fourth we surround our children with attention attracting screams from the time they are very young onward through their young lives even when my wife and i had young children and although we were both near 30 we were often the youngest parents with the oldest children the typical consequence of visiting another couple with kids the same age as ours was their immediate positioning in front of a tv so that they would not disturb the adults for a few hours the kids should have been tossed so to speak into the basement together without anything distracting so that they became bored and frustrated enough to invent their own entertainment which certainly would have entailed the generation of the spontaneous and mutually engaging drama that constitutes pretend play we worry very much about the content that children are exposed to on our ubiquitous personal phones even more invasive than the tv that everyone worried about for decades but it 's not the content as marshall mcluhan pointed out it 's the medium itself what children are not doing when glued to a screen is a more important determinant of their now too often pathological development then whatever content they might be exposing themselves to there is no good evidence for example that children who watch more violent stories or play more violent video games are driven towards violence by that content it is far more likely that kids with a propensity for violence at age two say are unlikely to mature out of that propensity if their salutary play with other children is constantly disrupted by the presence of screens fifth and perhaps as a consequence of older parents more resources and fewer siblings we radically privilege safety over play exploration curiosity autonomy and encouragement this proclivity has been accelerated by the rise of single mother families as mothers are more likely to be concerned about safety given the on average higher levels of threat sensitivity characteristic of women and less likely to facilitate the forms of play that appear risky in the short term but which have marked advantages in the broader social world and at more sophisticated stages of maturity this problem is exacerbated by the broader scale shortage of male primary school teachers the relative dearth of males in positions that enable the masculine socialization of children and the high probability that in the case of divorce primary custody will be awarded to the mother all of this is made worse by the broad scale of male patterns of child and adolescent care that now characterize our society none of this is remotely acceptable and it is certainly not sustainable the absence of father patterned socialization is a complete catastrophe for children as the clinical developmental literature makes perfectly clear we have become so deluded in our theories of identity that we now privilege to use that hated word the solipsistic self - pronouncement of developmentally delayed adolescents possessed though they are by the necessity to frantically engage in the kinds of pretend play they should have been encouraged to manifest when transitioning from the age of two to three this impulse for pretense suppressed by eatable helicopter parents re - emerges with pronounced motivational force and no shortage of moral outrage when interfered with when those damaged children escape from home to school or university and get enough freedom to embark upon their now terribly delayed journey of maturation they experiment with their gender identity even extending that into the world of sheer make - believe hence all the experiments with animal and fictional identities in precisely the manner of very young children attempting to find their place in the social world these attempts at identity development should be viewed with compassion reflective as they are both of a very disturbed society and more particularly a very disturbed childhoods but that does not mean that the identity claims of exceptionally immature adolescents buttressed by the idiot intellectuals who purport to serve as teachers and guides should now come to establish our social norms let alone our laws,0.6428,oh no wait that we are we are that 's a bad thing now side note violent crime has still been decreasing matter of fact firearm related homicides have gone down a whopping 39 % from 1993 to 2011 which is important to note because this steep scary graph is designed to plant the idea in your head that more legal gun owners equals more gun crime not true matter of fact in a study in 1994 they found that only 21 % of gun crimes involved a firearm purchase through a store or traditional outlet meaning legally the most recent study was suggests that it 's closer to between 3 and 11 % there 's a variance because these issues are kind of hard to study felons are not known for their truthful integrity again this unravels her argument because regardless of background checks the amount of gun crime committed by legal firearm owners is either the same or very likely lower than before rendering this graph irrelevant next point so we have looked at gun deaths and at gun ownership this chart puts them together it shows that among highly developed countries the more guns in a country the more gun deaths you can see that countries like switzerland which have relatively more guns than a country like the netherlands also have a higher gun death rate and here 's the us see the sl of hand we were just talking about homicide and gun purchases now we are back to gun deaths not homicide or violent crime because those would include suicides or violent intruders or criminals being killed by law - abiding gun owning homeowners likewise us states with more guns have more gun homicides there are outliers like idaho which has higher rates of gun ownership but low rates of gun murders but overall there 's a correlation between gun ownership and homicide rates and that relationship has held up in studies that control for things like poverty unemployment and crime actually no those outliers can be explained because there 's a strong correlation between gun deaths and big populated cities and gang violence that 's why the slight of hand is important sometimes she includes it sometimes she does not and if this particular study does not include big cities but poverty it renders it irrelevant because poverty is still the biggest indicator for violent crime far more so than mere gun ownership the correlation between gun ownership and gun deaths is even stronger for suicides it makes sense no it does not none of it does look behind you there 's what made sense depression with a gun is more dangerous than depression without one,0.745
"and so well then you know 5 years later the soviet union collapsed , no one saw that coming and it really do not collapse in 1989 in some sense , you know , like a huge machine like that does not fall apart all at once , it falls apart over time and then at some point it just becomes unsustainable and topples and you know , it 's like they lost faith in their doctrine and for good reason you know that the system in russia the soviet union , which was a collection of states , an empire and the system that mao establish in china and the system that still exists in korea as a remnant of the cold war and systems in south east asia and in africa were all predicated on marxist presuppositions presuppositions that were utopian in nature and that and that posited a utopian future where property was held in common and everyone had enough and everyone was called upon to do what they could ight , from each according to his ability , to each according to his need which is a lovely sentiment and you can imagine how it would be attractive even intellectually , because of course other systems , all other systems produce vast disparities in income it 's like a natural law , that 's actually governed by , you can model it with a distribution called the pareto distribution , and the pareto distribution looks like this it does not look like a normal distribution , a lot of you guys have been told about , not , normal distributions and how many things many things follow on normal distribution , most things , but that 's really a limited case you can understand a pareto distribution if you you have all played monopoly i presume at the beginning everyone has the same amount of money we will include property , the same amount of wealth and then what happens as the game progresses , and really as a function of chance i mean , i know that you have to use a head a little bit in monopoly but the basic rule is just buy everything you can get your hands on and then trade meanly , something like that so at the beginning everybody has the same amount and then as you begin to play if you had enough players you would develop a normal distribution because some people would win relatively consistently and some players lose relatively consistently and so the money starts to be distributed in a normal distribution , but the thing about money , and the thing about lots of things is that zero is involved and zero is a weird place because if you are playing a trading game and you hit zero then you are done and so , and it is very hard to recover from zero , and you know it 's really hard to recover , you know when you are doomed in monopoly you know , you , you can tell , you have got some resources but there is going to be some crisis when you land on some hotel and you are going to get wiped out , you know it , so there is a point at which you are headed for zero even if you have something you know and you might be rescued by , luck , but you know when you are doomed so what happens as you continue to play monopoly , more and more people stack up at zero and fewer and fewer people have more and more money and when the game is over every person has no money and one person has all of it , now the funny thing about that is in some sense that is how trading games work , you know , you got , you might wonder why there is inequality in a society and it is easy to consider that it 's because the society is corrupt and perhaps , you know , society is somewhat or horribly corrupt , that is the variation , there is no society that is not without its criminal element , its fixed element anyways trading games tend to produce a pareto distribution so that very many have very little and a tiny minority have a tremendous amount that 's the 1 % that you hear about , right , and the thing about the 1 % is that it has happened in every society that has ever been studied , it does not really matter what the governmental system is , it certainly happened under the soviets , that 's for sure and there was enough people that had enough zero that they just died , so , you know , the , the utopian dream was completely un - implementable for a variety of very complex reasons , one is that it is very hard to fight against that distribution pattern when people are trading because mere statistics will do that , and then there are other things , and i should tell you as well that the pareto distribution governs a lot of things , so , if you look at books , if i remember properly last year there was something like a million english language books published and i think that 500 of them sold more than 100,000 copies which is none , right , that is none , and of that 500 you can be sure that one of them was by stephen king and he took half the money because like there is 5 authors in the english language who are on every airport paperback stand occupying the top rung and that 's massive real estate , right , because it is replicated everywhere , and because they are so prominent and because they are no names when people are in a hurry and want something to read , they just grab that , and more money goes to those people , so you know , success breeds success and failure breeds failure , and it not necessarily linear and that is a really difficult thing to deal with , and it is hard on societies , because , one of the things we do know is that , you know , as you stretch out the inequality , you make men , particularly , on the lower end of the distribution , more and more likely to be aggressive , it 's sort of like , you imagine every man has a threshold for violence , um , and status is important to men , not that it is not important to women but , it 's different , it 's a different kind of status , it 's status that is important to men because it 's one of the things that makes them marketable as partners to women so it actually turns out to be quite important to men men tend to compete with one another for status , hierarchy position , and in a really unequal society , if you are like a low rung guy , then , and you do not have any opportunity to rise because the society is not structured so that there 's mobility , then the more aggressive guys , tend to turn to criminality , and you know",0.117,so why does trump set so many people on edge to recapitulate he is exceptionally extroverted particularly with regard to the aspect of assertiveness he 's also low in politeness now that combination has some overlap with narcissism not surprising in a figure who has been in the spotlight and strived to be for so many years however he is genuinely compassionate really quite surprisingly so and appears on the basis of his behavior behavior to be relatively or perhaps even markedly conscientious the presence of those aspects and traits mitigates against what could otherwise be the dangers associated with narcissism we might also spend some time in regard to trump 's personality considering his family and the evidence for the donald 's fundamental reliability and perhaps even goodness that its high level of function indicates the trump children are a remarkably scandal free and stable bunch certainly by the standards set by say hunter biden baron seems to genuinely admire his father donald jr has many of the same personality traits of his father for better or worse but he has also remained free of the taint of narcissistic privilege and power jared kushner married into the family but has certainly done it credit not least on the abraham accord front trump 's beautiful and elegant wife melania keeps her own counsel and is admirable in so doing she does not appear to think that she could or should run the country merely because she 's married to the man who does in marked contrast say to hillary clinton this familial honesty and reliability is particularly telling in the case of the trump family given that the almost universally democrat biased legacy media and its propaganda sistic agents would be thrilled to trumpet any possible misstep on behalf of those near the former president to the skies where there is smoke there is fire or so goes the cliche this is sometimes but not always true the converse may be something more reliable where there is absolutely no smoke even though many hawkey observers are not only watching but wishing for it to appear there is perhaps truly no fire zero scandal within the trump family is reminiscent for me of the zero wars of the trump presidency it 's something easy to take for granted given its too easily invisible non - existence as it 's hard to be grateful for a problem you just do not have but it is a relief and another indication that the bombastic donald j has at least properly ruled his own roost this is also no easy matter as we have seen in the appalling family scandals of the biden white house and is another fact mitigating against the claim that president trump is a danger on the temperamental front we should address one other relevant clinical personality issue following our analysis of personality not least through family consider before we do so that there exist two primary influences on behavior personality and the habit it constitutes and the specifics of the situation in question it turns out that knowledge of the former personality is clearly less useful than knowledge of the second situation or context when it comes to the specific and demanding task of predicting someone 's behavior current or future why not least because psychologically healthy persons are flexible adapting themselves to the specific demands of the current environment despite their trait proclivities even extroverts are likely to be quiet at least when they have been well socialized at a funeral in fact there is often something seriously wrong with those who lack such situational flexibility although strength of character with regard to honesty constitutes a marked exception the psychopath pathologies known as personality disorders which constitute a very serious source of suffering and social conflict are in fact precisely what emerge when someone is too rigid to change with the social demands of the moment this all means that it is most useful to gather evidence about how someone has acted in the past in a given situation if the goal is prediction of their behavior when placed in that situation once again and in the future we have that evidence already at hand in the case of trump this means that we do not have to rely on our observations of his personality for predicting his behavior even if they are well - founded compelling or even professional the man has already been president and for four years what did we learn first and foremost the time during trump 's tenure was peace particularly on the international front the importance of that nonpr really an accomplishment can hardly be overstated war in the nuclear age is infinitely dangerous had trump been the dictator in waiting his foes so loudly and fearfully presume him to be would not some evidence of that have made itself manifest say on the battlefield the typical nars particularly the more malignant sadistic maavalan types have absolutely no qualms about sacrificing others to their imperial ambitions indeed they may well regard it as a great honor for others to die in service of their own glorification trump by marked contrast embroiled the us the most powerful military force the world has ever seen in precisely zero wars zero is a very low number furthermore he negotiated the abraham accords the nine miraculous peace agreements that have built around israel a cohort of if not exactly arab allies at least not outright enemies in a just world trump and his previous team of diplomats should have been awarded the nobel peace prize for this accomplishment which was deemed impossible by the experts decade after decade of the state department it is of significant note too that these accords have held even after the events of october 7th 2023 and all the work that has been done mostly by the truly pathological actors of the islamic republic to set the muslim and indeed the broader world yet again against the jews let us reiterate in relation to our analysis we understand his personality arguably and may even have some remaining qualms about it however donald j trump has already been president and his tenure was marked by an absolute lack of cataclysmic occurrences we can therefore reliably rest assured on that front it might also be noted here that his impolite assertiveness and proclivity not to withdra draw in fear or dismay might be a real strength when dealing with dictators particularly in combination with his openness which makes him able to think outside the box and to bring to the negotiating table the advantage of unpredictability furthermore trump 's time as president was also marked by a not inconsiderable domestic economic record with the arguably marked exception of debt accumulation at least de ent economic performance and peace the fact of these twin facts has put many of the various concerns i once had about trump 's personality to rest as has my now more sophisticated appreciation for his particularized and unique combination of traits the events that have surrounded him as of late have done even more in that regard why well the republican candidate has now attracted a truly remarkable surprise in and stellar group of compatriots around him all highly accomplished and formidable figures each with their own marked eccentricities this is also not something that is likely to occur when someone pathologically narcissistic is running the show that group includes elon musk tony stark genius billionaire playboy philanthropist robert f kennedy charismatic eccentric and int intimidating telsey gabard who is in truth everything that camala harris plays that being vrma swami smart self - promoting creative witty articulate young entrepreneurial and fast on his feet as well as jd vance the hillbilly who pulled himself out of the appalachians by his bootstraps and who would insane times be a veritable poster boy for the hypothetically support the poor and working class left i have been joking to myself and some others in my circle that the x - men have now arrived in reality to rescue the republic this is a transformation that is not yet been fully noted even by the trump campaign itself despite its truly and surre revolutionary nature first and foremost among these new supporters and colleagues of the former president is elon musk he truly is and so comically an x - man as is starkly evidenced by the new name of the controversial social media platform he now owns and was once known as twitter he has been struggling to build x the everything platform for decades with that particular moniker in his mind the whole time the x - men like the avengers was a group of misfit mutant who came together to save the normies from the various monsters of the world it is frequently the case that life imitates art and there were perhaps real reasons stirring in the collective unconscious of the west inclining us to look toward the eccentric and supernormal for our salvation fiction meets reality in this strangest of ways in any case trump is now playing charles xavier to a strange group of mutants or if the similar metaphor of the avengers is more attractive conceptually captain america to the gods and superheroes let us assess this group of remarkable people psychologically one by one i am in fact in a better position to do just that with them than i was in the case of trump as i have personally met musk and the other group members several times with the exception of vp candidate vance with whom a podcast is currently being scheduled let us begin our analysis with mr elon musk the tony stark billionaire although importantly without the arms dealing before diving in however one final important fact should be noted pertaining to the former president the donald is evidently willing to share the spotlight with musk and apparently to listen to what the eccentric but stunningly capable and clearly genius level intellect former south african has to say a cynic might opine that the former president is merely capitalizing on the additional attention his delance with musk might bring him i would object however as a clinician on twin grounds first if trump truly were narcissistic musk might be the last person with whom he would deli the latter musk rivals or exceeds him in fame and power and definitely surpasses him in sheer genius that is not a situation that a truly self - centered and power mad dictator in waiting is likely to appreciate second with regard to garnering attention the genuine narcissist is someone unlikely to believe that anyone else is likely to bring anything of value to the table not already in display in consequence of their own boundless and singular specialness on to elon himself first and formost the world 's premier engineer and inventor is a man clearly and demonstrably capable of doing six impossible things at the same time this speaks primarily of his intelligence musk is exceptionally one in a billion high in general cognitive ability and openness a true genius albeit in the technical manner that is an observation not a criticism with regard to personality he 's not particularly extroverted tilting i would say in the opposite direction although not exceptionally so he is moderate in neuroticism carrying a fair burden of depression like pain with him not least because of a truly rough childhood which he alludes to but does not make a show of there is some withdrawal there run rough shaw over by his brilliance and openness and also some volatility evidenced in his behavior on x online somewhat reminiscent of trump himself musk is also a worker and manager hard and dedicated far beyond the norm so exceptionally high in conscientiousness and agreeable enough particularly on the compassionate side to be very pro - human he is however no pushover is not particularly polite and can and does make the difficult judgments of discrimination that allow him to continually operate and maintain multiple extremely large demanding stunningly diverse and truly cutting edge enterprises his staggering intelligence and business acumen means that he brings something near miraculous to the trump x - men team i would vote for trump as president if i could vote and i can not because i am canadian and forgive me for that just because musk has agreed to play a role in any new administration that trump might bring about he has even wittily proposed to head up a new department of governmental efficiency a phrase whose initials do g indicate the willingness in an inside joke manner to do only good every day as well as signifying a beused but knowing dog whose image has become a widespread meme it has been my diligent and hopeful observation that musk is a good man or at least a terrible complicated man trying very hard to be good which is all we could truly hope if we were the least bit realistic about human nature and our own prospects could musk do to the american deep state what he did for twitter could he prove run and cut so the republic could revitalize stranger things have happened in the course of human history javier mili is trying something similarly demanding in argentina and the us ofa has a remarkable capacity to reinvent itself someone like musk playing a key role in the governance of the greatest show on earth is a once- in a - lifetime opportunity that 's an adventure by anyone 's standards i have met with the next member of this group in question mr robert f kennedy five times speaking with and listening to him at some length each time he has the near manic energy and loquaciousness of those with exceptional verbal intelligence and the intensely focused concentration that pushes people who have that proclivity beyond even their own limits in pursuit of a goal he dreadfully well informed of veritable master of historical minui in a manner nonetheless relevant to today 's concerns he is also someone who like trump and musk can and does draw the overall picture accurately and even in a somewhat prophetic manner he is fearless and dedicated having stood up and successfully against even the largest giants of the proto fascist modern state and his single - handedly drawn public attention to what is genuinely a health crisis of gargantuan proportions despite its invisibility on the political stage until the current time he 's also someone once bitten twice shy a seriously wounded apostate again like trump and musk as well as telsey gabard from his own original favored party the democrats when i first spoke with m mr kennedy on my youtube channel i asked him the same question i always asked the many democrat leaders i have spoken with most privately unwilling as they generally are to risk being seen in public with the likes of me the question when do you think the left goes too far his answer to that in interview one at the very beginning of his presidential march i am trying to run a campaign that brings people together rather than a campaign that tries you know that is based upon you know that kind of tribalism of condemning people for ideologies that i do not necessarily agree with i had my doubts about the suitability of that answer in the long run having experienced precisely what happens when the left goes too far in my own private and personal life nonetheless on that occasion i let the question lie i can tell you however that mr kennedy had plenty to say on that topic when we spoke on youtube on our second occasion the ur while democrat contender for president had by that time experienced running hard and headlong into precisely what i had intimated in the form of my initial and purposefully leading question in consequence robert f detailed for at least an hour his utter dismay with the power mad corrupt ideologically possessed shenanigans of the progressive left the very force that could continue its current domination of the public discourse and seen if miz camala harris and the shadowy and unknown forces behind her ascent to power manag to maintain their positions come november what is kennedy like as a personality extroverted like trump although perhaps not as much so trump is hard to equal let lone top in that regard not without his pain and negative emotion like musk not too agreeable although not at all narcissistic despite his markedly forceful assertiveness in opinion and as a speaker this was evidenced not least by my comparative silence particularly during our second youtube discussion i am a very talkative verbally assertive person for better or worse but mr kennedy had this stage for the vast majority of our time together that was as it should be in my opinion given the circumstances but it is still something that does not happen to me very often even when i intend it to does this mean that rfk is inappropriately forward self - aggrandizing self - centered not my experience one anecdote quite tellingly reveals why rfk jr and i encountered one another one evening in a restaurant i happened to be dining in during my last tour i was there with dr phil in a private room in the back of the building mr kennedy happened into the establishment was informed that we were also there and sent someone forward to ask if he could come and say hello the fact that he so politely sought permission since no offense would have been taken had he not was something i noted as was his somewhat near apologetic entrance asking the two of us very graciously to forgive the intrusion an intrusion it was not as we were happy to see him and pleased that he dropped in he could have just taken that for granted and even justly,0.4622,oh well you know this survey says that students really support free speech and in a certain sense they are right there have been public opinion surveys that show that 's students i do not know we should not censor this speech we should not censor this speech the trouble is that when the students actually get to campus and when the rubber hits the road you know when they actually have to put their ideas into practice they completely balk they say disinvite speakers they shriek they yell they shout people down and in some cases like charles murray went during one campus visits they assaulted the speaker 's other people by the way have shown that all of these claims from the lefty journalists just are not true so and that is not just conservatives who say that this is people from across the political spectrum social scientists sean stevens and jonathan hite have shown this they there was this giant survey that i think a lot of the lefty journalists are relying on but when you focus the research down onto the kids who are actually in college now not the 35 year olds not the people who were out of college not even the millennials when you focus it on the i jim the generation that comes right after millennials people who entered college in 2015 and onward there is a downturn in support for controversial speakers these are not millennials we love to knock millennials there are plenty of reasons to knock them but the people who are actually shouting down conservative speakers right now and guzzling laundry detergent in the form of those delicious tide pods those are actually the next generation that 's ai - jen another writer robbie so of from reason writes how lefties who are using the general social survey the gss that 's what iglesias and all of those guys at waffle were citing there they are not including the people who were there now so sure it uses older generations it uses millennials but actually some of those statistics actually exclude the students who were in college they exclude those for instance who live in group quarters and i do not know if you have ever been to college but group quarters is a fancy way of saying dormitories that 's where people live in college and if it 's excluding them then not only is it giving you a lot of information that you do not need it 's excluding the only information you are asking for which is what do college students right now think of free speech now it 's true even on this survey there are increases in the tolerance for things like speech regarding homosexuality or speech regarding communism certainly decades ago this would have been unheard of to be so open and tolerant of those two things but obviously opinion has utterly shifted in america on those particular issues since the fall of the soviet union and since the gay rights movement think about racism however according to this survey in 1976 seventy - three percent of people thought that alleged racists should not be censored that number has dropped to 56 percent by 2015 mind you this is not saying we endorse racist speakers or we hold racist views it 's simply saying people who hold views that some might consider racist should not be censored and that level is dropping precipitously and of course it 's always a tough question to say well what is racism these days the left accuses anybody who wants to lower taxes of being a racist of ann coulter one time at when i was in college gave me excellent advice which is that when i left three calls you a racist you know that you have won the argument because they just resort to these attacks these vague attacks that just hit your character and in america there 's no worse thing to be called there is nothing worse than being called a racist in america they know that so they bandy the term about and now only 56 % of people believe that alleged racists should not be censored in 1976 a quarter of people thought that racist books should be banned from libraries about 25 % of americans that number has increased to 39 % by 2015 that books that are deemed racist now who knows what 's a what 's a racist book there 's that book always cited the bell curve which in one line says there might be racial differences in iq and this has no bearing on public policy the one line no for a few people have even read the book most people have just read summaries of it with that book be banned what else would it be banned would would other polemical books from conservatives social scientific books that disagree with leftist orthodoxy would those all be banned that is from 1976 to 2015 there has been a 60 % increase in americans who think that racist books or allegedly racist books should be banned from libraries that is a terrifying increase according to a yougov survey 58 % of students do not want to be exposed to intolerant and offensive ideas on campus the majority of students who go to college do not want to be exposed to offensive ideas the entire purpose of college is to exposed to offensive ideas that is why you go you want to be exposed to ideas that you have never heard of before that might offend your prejudices or the things that are familiar to you,0.1923,but i was again hearing an echo lewis you can not understand policing today andrew without understanding crime because policing is data - driven if blacks are arrested at twice the rate of whites there 's a very simple straightforward and non - racial explanation for that it 's because they commit violent crime at at wildly disproportionate rates blacks commit homicide at eight times the rate of whites and hispanics combined and if you take hispanics out of that equation you get a homicide disparity between blacks and whites of about 11 to 12 times obama refuses to tell the nation the truth about why police are in inner - city their neighborhoods they are there to protect the many innocent black lives that are being mowed down by these mindless drive - by shootings and to make police escape and to blame the messenger for the very uncomfortable truth about black crime is now resulting in even more black lives being lost as police back off of proactive policing you you have coined the term the ferguson effect that was your term was not it well the st . louis police chief sam dodson used it to refer to what was going on in st . louis after the ferguson riots after the michael brown hoax the hands up do not shoot hoaxes i then noticed that crime was going up across the country in cities with large black populations and i was hearing from officers across the country that they were experiencing a level of hatred and resistance on the streets that was nearly unprecedented thanks to this calumny of the black lives matter narrative and a police officer in chicago i was out there about two months ago told me he 's never experienced such hatred in his 19 years on the job he said the job is basically undoable and as a result of the narrative the cops are racist in conjunction with the the cursing the jeering the physical resistance the interference with their arrest cops are backing off of discretionary proactive policing and as a result what we saw last year a homicide increase in cities with black large black populations anywhere between 54 percent in washington dc to 90 percent in cleveland and overall a 17 % increase in homicides in the largest 56 cities that 's nearly unprecedented you you talked about when donald trump got up and gave a speech talking you know they everybody said oh what a dark dark speech because he talked about the rise in crime and that fact - check people were all saying no no the crime has been going down obama said it last night in his speech but you basically said trump was right absolutely right they are it 's extraordinary the resistance to acknowledging that proactive policing matters for better or worse nobody wants to admit that police can lower crime and they do not want to admit that when the police back off crime goes up what the inevitable strategy is for denying the ferguson effect is to use 2014 numbers and say well through 2014 crime was low and continuing to go down but it reversed in in the second half of 2014 for sure even after that 17 % increased in homicides last year were still below the early 1990s levels because that 's we have had a 50 % drop in crime over two decades but if we continue at this rate and we seem to be because this year we have had a 15 % increase in homicides on top of last year 's 17 percent increase if this continues it will not take very long to completely wipe out the two decades long violent crime decrease that this nation has enjoyed this plays into obama 's anti - gun narrative too it seems to me because when the police went out and took extraordinary not extraordinary measures but what can i call them aggressive measures to take guns off the streets of new york with their stop and search plan the liberals piled on and basically got stopped and searched revoked do not they i mean there are now more guns in these neighborhoods than there were before is that not true officers will tell you that people that were borderline before and were not necessarily carrying guns because of the risk of getting stopped are now caring is do we have a problem here with the okay the best gun control is proactive policing you know that that distinguishes the lawful gun carriers from the unlawful gun carriers and and when you have cops willing to get out of their cars at 1:00 a.m. and and and question a group of guys hanging out on a known drug corner one of whom seems to be hitching up his waistband as if he has a gun that deters thugs and gangbangers from packing heat but when officers are now not willing to get out of their cars because they are terrified that if it an encounter with a black suspect goes awry their career is at stake they will become the latest cnn racist cop of the week played in endless video loops when cops just drive on by and wait for a 911 call after somebody 's already been victimized that gives free rein to people with criminal intentions and and chicago right now is a crystalline example of the ferguson effect where you have stops pedestrian stops down ninety percent and twenty three hundred people as of july nineteen shot the number of police officers who shot people is 0.5 percent there were 12 police shootings compared to 2300 if you believe black lives matter narrative of course you would think that the majority of those 23 2300 shootings were committed by cops in fact cops were the 12 shootings were of armed and resisting suspects it 's blacks who were killing other blacks we are talking to heather mcdonald about her book the war on cops a best - selling book really brilliant reporting about the truth about what it 's like on the streets for police officers and what obama 's narrative is doing so you saw obviously the mothers of the movement as they were called who stood up at the democratic convention and talked about their children who had been killed when you see that i mean that 's a very powerful narrative obviously mothers who lose their children is tough narrative to counter do you do you feel that the word is getting out i mean you are talking about the facts you are talking about what you are saying is is really irrefutable do you feel that you have any chance of beating that kind of emotional narrative with the truth well not if hillary clinton is elected and this is not intended as any kind of political endorsement one way or another but clinton has put us on very clear notice that if she is elected she will double down on obama 's dangerous lies about the criminal justice narrative she 's announced that she wants to put the nation 's police through implicit bias training this is complete junk science it 's a fraud in fact officers are less likely to shoot blacks than whites they take longer to decide to shoot armed black suspects than armed white suspects and they are less likely to shoot unarmed lack suspects than unarmed white suspects but she is so desperate to pander to the black victim ologists that she 's going to continue this and we can look forward to a further breakdown of law and order more assassinations of cops and equally importantly the black victimization rate is going to continue going up and we are going to get lives lost like you know the the three - year - old boy who was shot in chicago on father 's day of this year who 's now paralyzed for life the three children in cleveland under the age of five who were killed in september alone last year nobody knows their names the idea that the press cares about black lives is a complete fraud everybody the world knows the name of the of the thug michael brown but when innocent black lives are taken by black gang by newark bangers the world looks the other way,0.6005,and i do not know how they sleep at night you know alcoholism and addiction are probably the most pervasive diseases in america i do not know of one family that has not been touched by the pain of these diseases and it 's particularly painful when you have someone you love unconditionally that is suffering from these diseases and by the way everybody needs to back off joe biden about this he loves his son back off it is okay for him to love his son and there 's nothing wrong with it they have no evidence of any kind of wrongdoing by joe biden and it infuriates me that they are using this heartbreak against joe biden in this way it 's just not right she is a perfect leftist she 's a perfect leftist nothing she said there has anything to do with the law everything she said there had to do with pulling heartstrings but really pulling them sort of in the wrong direction right like no one 's saying that joe biden can not love his son no one 's saying do not have sympathy for people that are hooked on alcohol and drugs right we all know somebody that 's been affected by alcohol and drugs we have all had our our own struggles whatever it might be nobody 's saying any of that the issue here first off what they got him on was tax evasion but the issues all the other stuff that i have now repeated ad nauseam for the 20 minutes or so that we have been doing this the idea that this has nothing to do with joe biden that 's what she repeatedly is saying there this has nothing to do with joe biden lady claire mccaskill i tweeted this at you yesterday so now i will repeat it on video and people can cut it and send it to you claire mccaskill who was vice president when crackhead hunter biden got a job for eighty thousand dollars a year at a ukrainian energy company with no qualifications his name is joe biden he 's the president now do you think that a ukrainian energy company might want to give a job to a guy who might have access to the vice president so that they could get some sort of deal pulled off does that seem too crazy to you or am i just being mean you tell me anywho uh let us do a couple super cuts here here is a super cut video of mainstream media reporting on the hunter bike there 's no evidence that hunter biden has done anything wrong there is no evidence of any wrongdoing between uh by biden by joe biden or by hunter biden there 's no evidence that joe biden actually did anything wrong or did anything to sway things in hunter biden 's favor he 's denied that his son ever lobbied him for anything there is nothing hunter there is nothing wrong that vice president biden did president trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving in a company board in ukraine i want to point out there 's no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you there is no evidence that anybody did anything illegal uh regarding the bidens uh and and ukraine and and joe biden was carrying out u.s policy president trump wanted dirt on joe and hunter biden trump 's claims about wrongdoing here are unsubstantiated we have looked lots of out outlets have looked hunter biden did nothing wrong vice president biden did nothing wrong at every single media outlet has said that there are no there 's no there there to these allegations lies and smears politifacts found no evidence to support the idea that joe biden advocated with his son 's interests in mind it 's true that there 's no evidence of any wrongdoing by vice president biden or that hunter biden uh broke any laws at all what it confirms is that hunter biden is a person of integrity hunter has done nothing wrong i have never a memoir like this one before this is hunter biden 's book beautiful things it 's breathtaking we should have just ended the show right there i actually should have just walked offset and just ended for the day like how could i beat that,0.7011,"there is no substitute for american strength and there is no justification for american weakness that 's what the world has been finding out over the course of joe biden 's presidency when joe biden entered office iran was under heavy sanctions and its proxies increasingly impoverished the abraham accords were beginning to consolidate a powerful anti - iranian sunni jewish alliance with saudi arabia widely assumed to be the next sho to drop afghanistan had not been surrendered to the taliban ukraine had not been invaded by russia less than three full years into joe biden 's term iran has been emboldened and its proxy strengthened all of this is linked to the biden administration 's decision to seek a deal with iran involving the unfreezing of funds and the freeing up of iranian oil flow as well as the biden administration 's early attempts to marginalize the saudi government and so two weeks ago iranian back terrorist group hamas launched the worst attack against jews since the holocaust hezbollah another iranian proxy which effectively controls lebanon and has at least 150,000 sophisticated rockets aimed at israel 's north has been firing sporadic rockets into israel 's north as well thanks to hamas 's attacks on israel and israel 's necessary response the saudis have now tabled talks regarding normalization with the jewish state and things are getting worse just yesterday the iran backed houthis who have seized control of much of yemen 's north fired three missiles at israel and america had to shoot them down using a carrier in the region here is brigadier general pat ryder pentagon press secretary explaining just what happened by posturing these us naval assets and advanced fighter aircraft in the region we aim to send a strong message intended to deter a wider conflict to bolster regional stability and of course to make it clear that we will protect and defend our national security interests to that end the crew of the guided missile destroyer uss carney operating in the northern red sea earlier today shot down three land attack cruise missiles and several drones that were launched by houthi forces in yemen this action was a demonstration of the integrated air and missile defense architecture that we have built in the middle east and that we are prepared to utilize whenever necessary to protect our partners and our interests in this important region there were no casualties to us forces and none that we know of to any civilians on the ground information about these engagements is still being processed and we can not say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting but they were launched from yemen heading north along the red sea potentially towards targets in israel remember it was joe biden 's administration that delisted the houthis those are the people who just fired those missiles as a terrorist group in 2021 despite the fact that their charming slogan runs quote death to america death to israel cursed the jews victory to islam it does not rhyme but you can see what it 's saying also yesterday iranian back forces launched a drone attack on a military base in southern syria where us troops have a presence one drone was down but another caused minor injuries the base is located according to the times of israel at a sensitive juncture often used by iranian backed jihadists to fery weapons to the hezbollah terror group that same day syrian opposition activists said that drones were used to an attack in o oil facility housing american troops in the region and that is not all on thursday night according to the jerusalem post drones and rockets targeted the a al - assad airbase which hosts us and other international forces in western iraq and multiple blasts were heard inside the base this is iran testing the united states without question and so last night joe biden had a really important job he had to reestablish america 's credibility particularly in the middle east he had to show iran and his proxies that america would not allow the region to spin into chaotic violence he had to demonstrate strength of will he had to show he would not be sidetracked onto other issues and that he was not under the misimpression he could simply throw money at his enemies by early indicators president biden has failed last night he gave a discombobulated and confused speech a bizarre mix of solid promises to back israel against kamas and off topic promises with regard to additional aid to ukraine strange blatherings about american islamophobia combined with a weird utterance regarding the necessity of a palestinian state it was not particularly reassuring for anyone which means in all likelihood that iran will continue testing the united states they will continue to poke and prod and up the ante in the expectation that joe biden is bluffing and will fold and here 's the real problem no one really knows if they are right including maybe joe biden right now on the northern border of israel hezbollah is mobilizing according to the wall street journal israel ordered the evacuation of a city close to the lebanese border reflecting the israeli military 's growing concern that a second front could open up to the north as it continues its bombing campaign in gaza including a strike on a church compound overnight now by the way that strike on the church compound which was originally reported by hamas it turns out it was not a strike on a church it was a place near a church as always hamas they lie israel on friday also released more details about the hostages captured by hamas israel 's defense ministry said residents of kirat shona a city of 22,000 people will be moved to guest houses now provided by the state israeli forces and lebanon 's kah have been exchanging fire continuously in recent days nowah may be attempting to up the anti in the north to draw troop presence away from the gaza strip or they may be testing seeing how far they can go without the americans getting involved heah has been attacking idf posts yesterday two kah members were killed and one moderately hurt israeli tank shells were preparing attacks there were drones that were hitting motor launching cells as well so things are heating up on israel 's northern front all of that is happening because iran is testing everywhere from iraq to syria to yemen they are testing literally everywhere in the region to see how far they can push before they get pushed back which is precisely what you would expect from a regime that believes that its opposition is weak and so that means that it 's up to the west to demonstrate strength obviously what that means for israel is they need to destroy kamas wholesale without a doubt everyone agrees on this kamas has to go if hamas were to survive the existential threat to the state of israel is quite real not just because kamas would continue to exist in the gaza strip and continue to prepare further terror attacks but also because this would inflame the palestinian authority and islamic jihad to start to increase the violence in the so - called west bank jud in samaria and it would prompt heah to increase it violence in the north providing israel with a three front war if israel is prompted into that three front war by the way israel will have to strike back with all of its strength which would presumably prompt the entry of syria and iran into any sort of war which would prompt american intervention so if you wish this thing to slow down if you wish for this thing to cool down what you need is for israel to be given a free hand to destroy hamas in the gaza strip while making clear to the rest of the region particularly irani iranian proxies that if they get involved they too will be destroyed and a second i want to give you the latest from the situation in gaza because it 's becoming increasingly clear what has to happen over there and then we will get to joe biden 's speech from the oval office last night again it was meant to be a speech of strength and resilience and instead it was confused it was discombobulated it was off topic it was very weird he said some good things and he said a lot of things that were either irrelevant or were an attempt to essentially cram a crap sandwich down the throat of the american people in terms of spending we will get to that momentarily first i want to talk to you about daily weare 's most trusted privacy partner and premier sponsor of this show expressvpn going online without expressvpn well

that many of these organizations are pushing a feminist progressive agenda and while it may be true that there are activists in media and they do often push a feminist progressive or left - wing agenda there are different reasons for it i will admit absolutely activists journalists exist and they will smear people for ideological reasons they will lie for ideological reasons but let me tell you a story about marketing a few years ago i was talking to a marketing consultant and i asked them why was it so many of these companies these new digital media companies are feminist and progressive and he said there 's a few simple reasons for one women share more than men that 's a fact it 's true and the reason people share for the most part is if something makes them feel and not only that anger is the most likely to get someone to share content that means making women angry is your best path to generating revenue and it would seem that a lot of the state of might actually be true so let us look at the data does it actually show that women are more likely to share content that angry women are more likely to share content and that 's the case is this why so many news organizations are progressive feminists [ music ] before we get started head over to patreon comm /team cast to become a patron and help support my work this is my job and if you like these videos and you like more on - the - ground reporting then please consider becoming a patron at whatever level you feel comfortable today to help me continue doing this work a couple days ago i did a story on this article from buzzfeed it says the accused the headline reads vulnerable women are routinely prosecuted and imprisoned for false rape claims in the uk the story is pretty defensive of women who have been proven to have filed false rape claims in one instance phone records proved a man could not have committed these attacks the woman is said to have hurt herself and i had to wonder why is buzzfeed defending convicted criminals and i started thinking that maybe it 's because the goal is to paint women as victims so that women will share the content thinking back to the story i was told by those marketing consultants so let us look at some of this data a website called social media explore take it with a grain of salt i am not familiar with their work and this could be speculation but they do have a lot of information about why people share the first section is titled the gender gap women share more than men especially on a daily basis as far as frequency of sharing 30 % of women report sharing content at least once a day with 7 out of 10 of those women sharing multiple times a day meanwhile half of men reported sharing multiple times a week but only 5 out of 10 of those men share on a daily basis ultimately women are 26 % more likely to share content more than once a day compared with men but why are both genders sharing content in the first place men are less diversified in their sharing motivations for both men and women the primary reason for sharing is overwhelmingly to entertain their friends with interesting content while over half of men 's sites entertainment as the main reason women came in nearly 20 percent lower suggesting they are more diversified in their primary motivations compared with men women were 22 percent more likely to cite expressing themselves to their friends with things they care about and 37 percent more likely to cite eliciting and response from their network as primary sharing motivation to put it plainly women are much more likely to share than men and there are 37 percent more likely to share because someone elicited an emotional response so is it any surprise then that media companies are going to crank out story after story painting women as victims and pandering to things that will make women angry in order to get them to share something that makes them a moute or so these women can show this is what they care about brand watch has a story from march 25th 2014 who runs the social media world men or women women use social media more often 30 percent of online us women check their social sites several times a day versus 26 percent of online u.s . men women interact with brands more often 55 percent of online u.s . women access deals compared to just 36 percent of online u.s . men 58 percent of those who consume news in social media are women let me repeat this 58 percent of those who consume news in social media are women 2 very important data points that women are the primary demographic that consumes news on social media,0.4085,so back to the analysis as approximately 7 p.m eastern time on saturday more than 90 million americans had already voted in the 2020 presidential election according to the university of florida u.s elections project this according to frank camp at daily wire that 's a combined 57.6 million mail - in ballots returned and 33.4 million in - person early votes cast several states have come close to matching their 2016 total turnout two states have already exceeded those totals voters in texas have already cast nearly 10 million ballots voters in hawaii have cast 484 000 votes that is 110 of their 2016 vote totals respectively there are other states that are already almost at their total vote total this would be like montana washington georgia new mexico they are all above 90 north carolina as well some states appear to be holding back maybe a lot of people are waiting for election day pennsylvania has only had 38.4 percent of their 2016 total ohio stands at 48.4 as of saturday looking at the polls in the battleground states it appears to be an increasingly tight race though incumbent donald trump lag slightly behind in key areas so that is where things stand right now right now if you had to sort of ballpark out which states you keep the closest ion based on the real club politics polling average it would be north carolina and florida would be early indicators of where the election stands if trump loses either one of those early then it 's going to be a bad night for trump probably um pennsylvania obviously is the key swing state at this point because trump still needs to pick up pennsylvania now there 's been a lot of talk about trump declaring premature victory speaking to reporters on sunday evening trump denied he would declare victory prematurely and there 's a lot of rumors that basically a lot of democrats are worried that trump is going to come out the night of the election because in - person election voting is likely to skew trump and say i won the election and then the democrat will not concede and then there will be chaos trump has basically said he 's not going to do this trump also added i think it 's a terrible thing when ballots can be collected after an election i think it 's a terrible thing when states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over i mean honestly i do not think that he 's completely wrong about that i mean we should generally know the election results the night of the election or as fast as humanly possible it is also true that while we do tabulate ballots for in some cases weeks after the election that 's why the original vote totals never look like the final vote totals the idea of being able to receive ballots after the election uh which is what you are talking about in pennsylvania is really not is really not great trump is uh likely to appear ahead in pennsylvania on election night but mail - in ballots are likely to come in the following days so mail - in ballots counted after election day is set forth in state by state rules are as legitimate as in - person votes recorded november,0.3687,well the people around you have been relatively carefully selected right as a consequence of analysis of their 12 years in school the university has made a determination that they know how to sit down and listen that hypothetically they are intelligent enough to understand the lecture and that they are very unlikely to disrupt the proceedings with any unexpected outburst of emotion or motivation now if anybody broke one of those rules you can be sure that your eyes would move very rapidly away from me and directly towards the person who was causing the trouble because that would take center stage now this room is actually supported by a million invisible processes so for example while you are sitting in here you do not have to worry about whether it 's raining because there 's a roof and you do not have to worry about whether the roof is going to fall in because you make the presumption that the people who built the roof are competent and the electricity works because the electricity is the utility is run by people who are competent so it 's almost always on buildings hardly ever burn down the electricity hardly ever fluctuates there 's thousands of people out there working as hard as they can diligently to make this environment constant enough so that you can ignore all the thousands of things that you are ignoring so that you can concentrate well enough to attend to the few things that you are attending to while you are in this room you are a walled city there 's multiple walls and those walls protect you from what 's outside the walls you can think about it this way this is a dowst image of reality now people think about this as a metaphysical symbol but it 's not a metaphysical symbol it 's an unbelievably practical symbol the dsts believe that the world the reality is made made up essentially of chaos and order chaos is all those things you do not understand so i would say that chaos is all those things that exist outside of your perceptual preconditions order is all the things you do understand and all the places you go where the things that you do produce the results that you intend and the dsts would say everywhere you go is like that everywhere you go has things that you understand that are orderly and has things that you do not understand that chaotic and the chaotic things attract your attention because you already understand the orderly things if something unexpected happens your nervous system automatically reacts to it and orients you towards it and sometimes that can be catastrophic so this is an experience that some of you will have in the next four years undoubtedly there 's a number of you that want to go to medical school or to graduate school or to law school or to business school and a certain percentage of you will take the admission tests that will determine whether or not you are able to take that path and a certain percentage of you will score below the 50th percentile on those tests and that will mean you will not be going to those institutions and when that happens first of all you will shake and tremble when you open the envelope to find out your results and second if you have not achieved the score that you expected that you will that you achieve your world will fall apart and what that will mean is that you descend from the domain of order into the domain of chaos and that happens to people all the time it happens to people when they develop an illness that 's serious that they can not control because then their body stops becoming something they can predict and starts to become some something that they can not predict it happens to people when they are in an intimate relationship and they are betrayed they assume fidelity and the person tells them that they have had an affair that 's chaos that means you do not know who that person was the future you imagine no longer exists your perceptions of people are erroneous at some level of analysis that you do not understand it 's conceivable that you are naive beyond belief and that everything you believed about yourself and other people up to that point is false and when a revelation occurs that knocks out one of the walls that supports you and you descend accidentally into chaos you will regard that as one of the worst experiences of your life when that happens to you your brain knows exactly what to do it stops thinking about the future it stops saving up resources for the future it puts you in emergency preparation mode so that you are ready to do anything at the drop of a hat because you do not know what to do so your body prepares to do everything it shifts your cortisol levels up it activates your left and right uh uh cores your lyic system and your motivational systems are disinhibited turned on and you sweat and you can not sleep because the orderly structure that you thought you inhabited that provided you with security and direction has now disappeared and the dost believe that the world is always an interplay between chaos and order and that if you live your life properly you stand with one foot in order and one foot in chaos because if you are only in order nothing that 's interesting ever happens to you nothing is anything but a repeat of all of all the things that you already know that 's the state that fascists desire because fascists desire things to be exactly the way they are forever and if you are in a state that 's only characterized by chaos you are at sea or overwhelmed or things have fallen apart for you and there 's too much of everything for you to deal with now the dst being very wise people know other things as well they know for example that chaos can turn into order that 's why there 's a white dot in the middle of the black paisley and they know that order can turn into chaos which is why there 's a black dot in the middle of the white paisley and the dost believe that a meaningful life the optimally meaningful life is to be found on the border between chaos and order and i would say that your nervous system tells you exactly when you are there and it 's a kind of place and you can tell when you are there because you are secure enough to be confident but not so secure that you are bored and you are interested enough to be awake but not so interested that you are terrified and when you are in a state like that when you find things interesting and meaningful time slips by you and you are no longer self - conscious this is a medieval christian representation of the nature of reality on the outside you have the virgin mary inside the virgin mary you have have god the father and god the father is supporting a crucifix with an individual on it the individual in christian thinking is christ what does this image mean the wall city divides order from chaos or order from nature we think about nature as the thing that 's outside of what we understand that 's mother nature mother nature gives birth to all things that 's the idea that 's expressed in this image so the virgin mary is standing for mother nature out of mother nature arises order and tradition that 's true for primates like chimpanzees as much as it 's true for us any social animals that are grouped together have to form an orderly structure that they can inhabit together that defines their boundaries and their goals because otherwise they fight each other to the death so in the state of untrammeled nature as hobbs pointed out it 's every man for himself and without the order that tradition brings there 's nothing but chaos and chaos is murderous and unproductive,0.3224,but if you go to a church and they tell you what we will schedule you to get baptized next month you can catch us on our baptism to sunday you need to go to and you need to go to another church carl what 's up carl thank you all you all give carl a shout - out for doing the mines today he always do a really good job it 's a car if they tell you to that they schedule baptism next week you need to go to another i will tell them to do it right now and i am not to say that because because i am hoping that that 's right i am saying it because if you read the bible there 's no situation in the bible that anybody had ever the schedule of baptism people were baptism baptized instantly upon their acknowledgment and necessity to be born again baptized immediately for those who just joined we talk about some christian stuff right now we talk my salvation we talk about being saved do not go away show time then they will church telling you that you need to schedule a baptism i

baptize me in the name of jesus do not baptize me and the father son holy spirit under baptize me in the name of jesus there 's power in the name of jesus demons tremble at the name of jesus there 's no other name under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of jesus everybody in the bible that were baptized were baptized in the name of jesus because that 's power in the name of jesus if there were not power in the name of jesus then nobody would nobody would be even articulating or using the name jesus demons would not be fleeing at the name of jesus they would not have crucified pretty much the postures for preaching in the name of jesus tell them pastor baptize me in the name of jesus that 's the word of power is it not entitled it 's in the name and if you disagree with me show me somewhere in the bible where they cast out a devil in the name of the father son holy spirit showed me that somewhere in the bible give me a scripture it never happened they used the power to name of jesus look at her back there she had to come getting shot nicely i am in here could no let us see please talk about family courts they are destroying families was to those who did justice to the fatherless children that 's exact thank you so much i appreciate it let us see the next person mary thank so much for the super chat,0.5157,bernie sanders thanking all of those people so what you have a choice between is an isolationist old commie and and joe biden who has the principles of a jellyfish i wanted to thank rasheeda to leap for doing that exactly when she and other members of the so called our doing is every day because i know these guys when they are out they are fighting what rasheeda is doing every day is standing up for the working families of this country and day after day having the courage to take on powerful special interests and she 's really she 's really standing against the tools the tools now again bernie sanders he let us just put this way his group is rife with anti - semites bernie sanders is not an anti - semite as far as i know man 's jewish at least by birth but the but the fact is that bernie sanders surrounds himself with the worst sort of anti - semites mean he campaigns with linda sarsour no hon omar an rasheeda talib but put aside the anti - semitism his actual foreign policy is extraordinarily radical and so democrats made sure all the sloganeering but barack obama did this too right barack obama was into the isolationist sloganeering then he became president launched a war in libya launched a drone war increased troop presence in iraq in afghanistan had reversed himself an increased troop presence in iraq in order to fight isis it turns out that that presidential seat tends to make you more interventionist because when threats around the world materialize well you got to do something about it but bernie might not do that and so democrats might have to come to grips with the fact that all of their sloganeering is generally stupid and that a man who puts that into practice is actually dangerous there 's an article in the washington post today by sean sullivan talking about bernie sanders his foreign policy says when bolivia 's leftist president was pressured to resign by his country 's military after an audit found signs of a tainted election two months ago many american leaders showed little interest in condemning the ouster some said it was a potentially positive step for democracy a sign as president trumpeted that the will of the people will always prevail a sharply different response came from bernie sanders who immediately condemned quote what appears to be a coup the ousted leader evo morales would challenge term limits remain in power later thanks the senator from vermont and democratic presidential candidate referring to him affectionately as brother most of sanders his rivals paid little attention to the incident in a faraway place but for sanders the episode offers a glimpse into an unorthodox foreign policy worldview basically as the same foreign policy world viewed as noam chomsky has a radical radical leftist who believes that america 's role in the world is based in racism imperialism colonialism it 's like he read vi lenin 's imperialism back in college and you never got over it a garbage book by the way with the iran crisis thrush foreign affairs to the forefront of the campaign just as sanders rises in early state polls democrats who previously waved off the senators views his fringe now must contemplate the possibility of a democratic socialist becoming commander - in - chief of the united states trump is already up ended the world order with an america first approach that tests western alliances sanders would deliver another jolt echoing someone from criticisms of military action and free train but realigning the country 's priorities even more strongly well what that actually means is that he would presumably try to make alliances with actual terror groups right he suggested that the united states withdraw military aid from israel and give it to an actual terrorist group in the gaza strip hamas beyond his objections morales is removal sanders has point cently declined to label venezuelan president nicolas maduro a dictator because he is a commie he called israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu a racist for the great sin of noting that the arab parties in israel stand for the destruction of the state of israel he has campaigned with rashidah to leave in ohio maher both of whom favor sanctions against the state of israel he said that china has done more to address extreme poverty than any country in the history of civilization neglecting the forced abortion of some 350 million children minimum and the forced sterilization of presumably tens of millions of women and also neglecting the fact the only thing that allowed china to rise from poverty at all was their engagement in the free market and free trade also sanders opposed the 2000 invasion of iraq that 's going to be his bumper sticker against joe biden this week and david miller former adviser to six secretaries of state now senior fellow at carnegie endowment for international peace he says i think would be a fundamental shift assuming his principles hold in the transition from campaigning to governing even some democrats note sanders has put much more emphasis on domestic policies than global ones that 's right because domestic socialism is more popular than international alliances with some of the worst people on on the face of the planet senator richard durbin was a wild leftist said it has not been his strong suit but sanders and company are making the case that joe biden is basically on trump 's side that biden and trump are closer together than biden and sanders which of course is true when it comes to foreign policy that 's a dangerous choice for democrats to make but bernie is gaining and he is picking up steam also because running this close to joe biden elizabeth warren is still carrying 15 to 20 percent of the vote and so sanders is now reorienting himself he 's saying,0.6611,and they are definitely out for assange because he published some of their secret documents the daily beast betsy woodruff noted that the guardian then went and started stealth editing their piece self editing means you go and you edit a piece without actually note noting the correction sometimes it 's innocuous and sometimes you are actually changing the material in the piece without notifying readers so that you are sort of hiding the boo - boo that you made before the guardian weakened some of its language in the mana fort assange story so originally it said it is unclear why manta fort wanted to see assange and what was discussed they changed it to read it is unclear why manta fort would have wanted to see assange and what was discussed right before the last apparent meeting as opposed to before but the last meeting so they are now weakening all the language men afford was we say is now threatening a lawsuit against the uk guardian so all of the hubbub yesterday over this bombshell story that mana ford had met with massage it turns out that that may be collapsing in on itself meanwhile there 's a story today about jerome corsi who apparently has a deal with president trump jerome corsi is the author and conspiracy theorist who had written an entire book about why barack obama was born in kenya he used to write for worldnetdaily and he now claims in a forthcoming book that he has a joint defense agreement with president trump that was provided limited immunity during his testimony before a special counsel robert mullins grand jury to discuss a cover story he claims he crafted for trump confidant roger stone this according to the daily caller course he has been interviewed six times in the investigation over the course of more than two months and he writes in a new book that he entered into a defense agreement with trump after being advised that trump 's lawyer jay sekulow was interested in the arrangement the defense agreement would basically involve corsi under investigation talking with trump 's team to inform them of the questions he was being asked by muller this of course would make muller deeply upset and angry because you do not want your witnesses talking to one another and getting their story straight describing his interactions with the special counsels office corsi claims he was granted what 's known as limited use immunity for testimony he gave during his september 21st grand jury appearance regarding conversations with roger stone about an august 31st 2016 memo he wrote about former clinton campaign chairman john podesta corsi says she received immunity for testimony that he and stone developed a cover story self explained stones now infamous to august 21st 2016 tweets that would soon be possessed his time in the barrel according to core c he and stone hatched a plan in which course he would write a memo about the podesta is to allow stone to cite it as the basis for his sweet retro actively so the implication from stones tweet is that he knew in advance about wikileaks releasing podesta 's emails and then wikileaks released the emails showing that stone had been coordinating with wikileaks and presumably if stone was in touch with the trump campaign then this would be the avenue that which russian collusion was taking place corsi supposedly testa is going to testify that he and stone came up with an arrangement where he would sort of backfill the story instead of it being that stone was working with wiki and then he sort of let the cat out of the bag saying that wikileaks was going to release stuff on john podesta now the story was going to be that your own course he had come up with a memo and that was the basis for stones tweet the revelation of hacker would undercut stones testimony to the house intelligence committee that opposition research on the podesta brothers business activities was the catalyst for the tweet stone vehemently denied course he 's claim about the origin of the memo to the daily caller on monday he insisted that he and course he discussed the podesta brothers activities and that his tweet was a reference to oppo research that would come out on the topic and there are a bunch of twitter posts on this particular subject of course he announced the release of his book on monday in an interview he also claims that prosecutors wanted him to plead guilty to making false statements regarding wikileaks he rejected the offer saying he would not plead guilty to a crime that he did not commit and again he says that jay sekulow trump 's lawyer suggested a mutual defense agreement that could be verbal in nature and did not need to be put in writing joint defense agreement are common in criminal proceedings when multiple witnesses and investigative targets are dealing with the same prosecutors trump has one with paul manafort for example so here 's where things start to get dicey does it look like paul manafort and jerome corsi and president trump are coming up with a mutual defense agreement because they are trying to get their story straight and protect themselves from the from the special investigation of robert miller or is it the robert muller is actually being pradesh estat he has that he 's being predatory that he actually is trying to peel off these people one by one and hit them with false allegations and then force them to turn on each other and testify about each other falsely and so you need a mutual defense agreement so that people can coordinate with each other from an offense perspective the latter from a prosecution perspective the former but does any of this look particularly good for president trump not really when you are coordinating with other witnesses in a case about you it looks like you are trying to set up some sort of cover story course he writes of one instance in which his lawyer had contact with trump 's lawyer he says he wanted his lawyer to warn trump we had to assume the special counselor would have everything all emails text messages written notes phone records could be obtained by search warrants i wanted the president i wanted the president warned not to give in - person verbal testimony to muller under any circumstances he said expressing concern the prosecutors removing sort of perjury trap against him from misremembering details about a july 25th 2016 email that he received from roger stone and one of those emails supposedly is an email from 2016 from corsi to roger stone about the wikileaks email dumps nbc news has obtained draft court papers since of course he by miller 's office in which course he apparently said that roger stone asked him in the summer of 2016 to get in touch with an organization identified by corsi as wikileaks about unreleased materials relevant to the presidential campaign the email from the two coracii on july 25 2016 from stone apparently says get to assange at equatorial embassy in london and get the pending wikileaks emails of course he said he declined the request he made clear to stone that an attempt to contact wikileaks could put them in the investigators crosshairs according to the draft court documents muller 's team said that was a lie instead of turning down the requests course he in fact passed it along to a person in london according to the draft court documents so we will have to see how all of this shakes out course he meanwhile says i do not do any of this stuff and the muller investigation is simply trying to push me into making false statements about president trump with the threat of prosecution looming over my head all of which raises another question is president trump going to solve this sort of gordian knot by simply cutting it and pardoning paul manafort and this is one of the pieces of speculation that is out there today i think this is highly highly unlikely i will explain why in just one second first let us talk about your genetics,0.3288,okay now they get to robert forgive me for uh for taking a while to get there it 's on page 72 of the opinion quote we now turn to the concurrence in the judgment which reproves us for deciding whether rowan casey should be retained or overruled that opinion which for convenience will simply call the concurrence recommends a more measured course which it defends based on what it claims is a straightforward starry decisis analysis the concurrence would leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all and would hold only that if the constitution protects any such right the right ends once women have had a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion the concurrence does not specify what period of time is sufficient to provide such an opportunity but it would hold that 15 weeks the period allowed under mississippi 's law is enough at least absent rare circumstances there are serious problems with this approach says the majority it is revealing that nothing like it was even recommended by either party as we have recounted both parties and the solicitor general urged us to either reaffirm or overrule roe vs casey when the specific approach advanced by the concurrence was broached at oral argument both respondents and the solicitor general emphatically rejected it respondents council termed it completely unworkable and less principled and less workable than viability the solicitor general argued that abandoning the viability line would leave the court and others with no continued guidance what 's more the concurrence has not identified any of the more 130 amicus briefs filed in this case that advocate its approach the concurrence would do exactly what a criticized roe for doing for doing pulling out of thin air a test that no party or amicus asked the court to adopt so that is the majority just wood shedding justice roberts which he fully deserves by the way worth noting when it comes to justice roberts the fact that he wished to craft out of whole cloth like out of his head out of his crazy head a new standard that was kind of like the under burden standard like give ample opportunity for an abortion like a completely arbitrary standard that no one suggested not the not the people who are in favor of roe not the people who are against roe not the 130 amikai briefs that were filed in the case he was just going to create out of whole cloth a constitutional standard it shows you who chief justice roberts is he did the same thing when it came to the obamacare case he simply created out of whole cloth a precedent whereby a tax was not a tax except when it was a tax this is what justice roberts does and he thinks somehow he 's upholding the institutional legitimacy of the court by never coming down with rules that are explicit in the constitution it 's insane and ridiculous and the majority just kicks him about for it quote the concurrence 's most fundamental defect is its failure to offer any principle basis for its approach the concurrence would discard the rule from roe versus casey that a woman 's right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is regarded as viable but this rule is a critical component of the holdings in both row and casey and sorry decisis is a doctrine of preservation not transformation therefore a new rule that discards viability can not be defended on star decisis grounds the concurrence concedes its approach would not be available if the rationale of row and casey were inextricably entangled with independence upon the viability standard but the concurrence asserts that the viability line is separable from the constitutional right they recognized and can therefore be discarded without disturbing any past precedent that is simply incorrect ro 's trimester rule was expressly tied to viability viability played a critical role in later abortion decisions if viability was not an essential part of the rule adopted a row the court would have had no need to make the comparison that it made in casey the holding in kaladi vs franklin is even more instructive than they go through a series of cases in which viability was used as the standard by the supreme court so you can not discard roe versus roe or casey and and with their with regard to the viability standard and somehow uphold the underlying rationale they say not only is the new rule proposed by the concurrence inconsistent with casey 's language it is also contrary to the judgment in that case in later abortion cases in casey the court held that pennsylvania 's spousal notification provision was facially unconstitutional not just that it was unconstitutional as applied to abortions sought prior to the time when a woman has had a reasonable opportunity to choose for all these reasons sorry decisions can not justify the new reasonable opportunity rule propounded by the concurrence if that rule is to become the law of the land it must stand on its own but the concurrence makes no attempt to show this rule represents a correct interpretation of the constitution the concurrence does not claim the right to a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion is rooted in the nation 's history and tradition nor does it propound any other theory that could show the constitution supports its new rule and if the constitution protects a woman 's right to obtain an abortion the opinion does not explain why that right should end after the point in which all reasonable women will have decided whether to seek an abortion the concurrence would leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all but another day would not be long in coming because other states are already setting deadlines for obtaining an abortion that are shorter than mississippi 's so in other words he 's a coward is what the majority is saying like you want to concur and create an unworkable rule in which on an ad hoc basis you strike down laws but you are going to spend the rest of your life figuring out whether to strike down laws or not then even if the court ultimately adopted the new rule suggested by the concurrence as the majority we would be faced with the difficult problem of spelling out what it means for example if the period required to give women a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion were pegged as the concurrence seems to suggest at the point when a certain percentage of women make that choice we 'd have to identify the relevant percentage it 'd be necessary to explain what the concurrence means when it refers to rare circumstances that might justify an exception in summit the concurrence 's quest for a middleway would only put off the day when we 'd be forced to confront the question we now decide,1.037,shapiro you will save 50 off your very first month of coverage that is puretalk.com promo code shapiro puretalk is simply smarter wireless go check them out and save yourself a bundle right now puretalk.com promo code shapiro to get started well the world started to panic late last night when it appeared that there might be a nuclear meltdown in ukraine over russia shelling a nuclear power plant according to the associated press however no radiation was released from a russian attack at europe 's biggest nuclear power plant in ukraine firefighters have extinguished a blaze at the facility according to u.n and ukrainian officials on friday russian forces continue to press their campaigns to the country despite global condemnation the international atomic energy agency 's director general rafael mariano grossi said on friday that the building hit by a russian projectile at this particular plant was not part of the reactor and said it was a training center at the plant nuclear officials from sweden to china said there were no radiation spikes that had been reported ukrainian officials said russian troops took control of the overall site the plant 's staff were continuing to ensure its operations so electricity has not been cut across ukraine thanks to the takeover of the nuclear power plant in the frenzied initial aftermath when the risk of a radiation release was not clear the attack caused worldwide concern and evoked memories of the world 's worst nuclear disaster which of course did happen in ukraine at chernobyl facing worldwide indignation over the attack russia sought to deflect blame without producing any evidence defense ministry spokesperson igor konoshenkov blamed arson rather than artillery fire he claimed that the uk ukrainian sabotage group had actually occupied the plant fired on russian patrol and then set fire to the building as they left all of this of course raised the alarm because when we look at the situation in ukraine there are a lot of unintended consequences that are possible which we will get to in just a moment according to the wall street journal the russian forces continued pushing up north from the south they reached a place called enerhodar on wednesday after attempted surrender negotiation failed a large column of russian forces attacked the city on thursday webcam footage showed a huge fireball rising behind a church in the city a short distance from the nuclear facilities and then two munitions possibly illumination rounds landing on the compound itself the video is in fact pretty stunning meanwhile russia continues to pound a bunch of ukrainian cities the war that putin launched on ukraine more than a week ago has run into fierce ukrainian resistance according to the wall street journal while russian forces have advanced in the northeast and south of the country the offensive the offensive has continued to stall around kiev and moscow has now resorted more to indiscriminate shelling of civilian neighborhoods in cities like kharkiv chernahev maryapol and sumi russian shelling in the power plant area paused after 3 a.m local time at the time of the russian attack two of the six reactors were operating the plan 's management switched off reactor number three at 2 26 a.m leaving only number four online according to janz stolzenberg the secretary general of nato he said the shelling of the plant just demonstrates the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it for his part vladimir zelinski spoke with president biden about the attack on the plant and biden urged russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access access to the site us 's energy secretary jennifer granholm said on twitter she 'd spoken with ukrainian energy minister she said we have seen no elevated radiation readings near the facilities there were a bunch of false reports at the very beginning that this was going to turn into a full - scale nuclear meltdown which again underscores the fact that you can not predict what 's going to happen in a war meanwhile vladimir zolensky keeps calling on the west for more intervention he says we are fighting for our people we are fighting for our land we do not have nuclear arms we do not have oil and gas to fill the world with but we have our people we have our land and for us that is our gold that 's what we are fighting for we have nothing to lose other than our freedom our dignity is our greatest treasure there 's also a propaganda war that 's going on between ukraine and russia at the moment which is why there 's a humanitarian ceasefire that has been signed temporary local humanitarian ceasefires allowing for humanitarian corridors so civilians can be evacuated and food and medicine can be delivered by the way it 's also in russia 's interest to destabilize the rest of europe by effectively forcing out millions of ukrainian refugees into the rest of eastern and central europe which is exactly what is happening right now according to the washington post russia has sent nearly all of its assembled combat power into ukraine on thursday they unleashed some of the most intense fighting since the invasion began with local officials pleading for help as ground troops seized or encircled strategically important southern cities vladimir putin for his for his part he said that the mission was quote going according to plan and in full compliance with the timetable despite widespread agreement among western military analysts the invasion had been slowed by unexpectedly fierce ukrainian resistance and of course the images that are coming out of this war are stunning to a lot of people because this is what it looks like when it 's not the united states running war when it 's russia running a war the fact is that when first world nations run wars they are very meticulous in how they go about fighting those wars they try and hit very specific military targets you do not see a lot of tape coming out of indiscriminate rocket fire against civilian targets when israel fights a war they actually drop knock bombs on the top of buildings to evacuate the building before they bomb the building when the united states fights a war they are firing missiles through individual windows when russia fights a war they are fighting a war like 1945 style they are just firing munitions at anything that they think is going to achieve some sort of objective for them strategic or otherwise and that includes killing a lot of civilians they want to cover up for that fact by allowing humanitarian aid but mostly what they want is more streams of refugees because again that encourages the west to try and make some concessions to him to make all of this stop he 's ratcheting up the pressure not just on ukraine but on the west the west to force ukraine into some form of surrender and realistically speaking that is probably the most likely scenario here is that the west negotiates some sort of separate peace with the russians without a lot of ukrainian input and and just carves off part of the donbass region and gives it to russia in a final attempt to appease and then they say if you ever come in here again then we are going to establish a no - fly zone you have to re - establish deterrence because deterrence obviously do not work in ukraine the problem is once the deterrence has not worked as we discussed yesterday you start to run out of options very very quickly according to the washington post harrison among the first ukrainian cities to be encroached upon by russian forces was running out of medicine is facing disaster within days if that humanitarian corridor was not established according to the secretary of the city council galena lujova she said people are in a panic people are tense people are frightened to the core of their souls reports from other cities in ukraine 's south told a story of increasing desperation as communications and transport routes were cut off and supplies dwindled the mayor of mario paul said had a russian siege and hours of showing that battered railings and bridges had cut off all water power and food supplies the mayor of odessa which is a major report on the black sea said the population was preparing to mount a defense amid unverified reports a large fleet of russian warships was heading toward the waters off the coast when you look at the map what you see is that russia has taken over literally the entire southern border of ukraine outside of the area around odessa because they now have control over the sea of azov they have control over large swathes of the black sea they have also taken control of pretty much the entire ukrainian northern border up to the ukrainian border with belarus and belarus has become effectively a russian client state at this point there 's been talk about whether the russians go into moldova when all this is over that if the pressure is ratched up ratchet up further and further by the west russia says,0.7893,the joke is on the left the only way to see it is on the big screen matt walsh goes deep undercover to infiltrate the weird dirty world of race hustlers and grifters watch as he hilariously exposes the absurd truth behind the left 's agenda theaters are selling out across the country when they do more screens are added so if you have been to mist.com and you do not see a theater in your city go check again be part of the greatest troll on the left ever performed get your tickets join the fun on opening weekend go to mist.com for tickets and showtimes right now now again this is all part and parcel of a western belief that american military force that western military force that force of arms against the world 's most evil people is somehow bad which is why the biden harris administration sees the afghanistan pull out not as what it was a massive debacle a failure of not just imagination but of practical application they do not see that as what it is a full - scale disaster for america that has led to great scale aggression by russia by china by iran instead they see it as victory k harris has treated afghanistan as a victory the only sin apparently according to kamla harris with regard to afghanistan is that donald trump went and visited the graves of dead troops at arlington national cemetery last week that is the big sin so kamla harris put out a statement over the weekend reading thusly as vice president i have had the i have had the privilege of visiting arlington national cemetery several times it is a solemn place a place where we come together to honor american heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service of this nation it is not a place for politics and yet as was reported this week donald trump 's team chose to film a video there resulting in an altercation with cemetery staff let me be clear the former president disrespected sacred ground all for the sake of a political stunt i will always honor and cherish the service and sacrifice of all america 's fallen heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our beloved nation and our cherish freedoms i mourn them and salute them and i will never politicize them no you will just get them killed will not you you they will just get them killed h harris was the last person in the room on afghanistan she has celebrated every aspect of the afghan pullout she never got in contact with any of the families of the troops the big sin is that donald trump recognized the failures of the biden administration and went and paid homage to the troops that 's the big problem here but we are supposed to believe that it 's all about optics it 's the optics of how she treats the troops not the underlying disdain she has for the reality of power politics in a world filled with nefarious powers the great failure of the biden administration is that american troops died because they were weak because biden and harris are weak that is why those troops died the reason that we have what we have in ukraine is because biden and harris are weak in the face of aggression the reason that china is consistently threatening taiwan is because biden and harris are weak the reason iran is still blowing up shipping in the red sea is because biden and harris are weak that weakness leads to people dying and the reason that they refuse to see this is because to say the opposite would be to recognize a truth the left can not bear and that truth is again the problem of human evil and the reality which is that western civilization is less evil than its competitors period end of story but harrison company will never acknowledge that because to them western civilization boils down basically to their favorite economic and social policies that 's what western civilization boils down to it does not boil down to constitutional rights and freedoms it does not boil down to christian - based natural law it does not boil down to any of those things it boils down instead to gay pride flags and welfare state that is that is what democracy means to the left and what that also means is that anybody all over the world who is quote unquote suffering who is who is quotequote victimized is actually victimized by western society success is a hallmark of victimization according to kla harrison company that perverse perspective is why evil progresses in the world whenever the left is in char in the west tom cotton was making this point over the weekend on the sunday shows here he was ripping into kla harris you know who the families also invited joe biden and kla harris where were they joe biden was sitting at a beach kla harris was sitting at her mansion in washington dc she was four miles away 10 minutes she could have gone to the cemetery and and honored the sacrifice of those young men and women but she has not she never has spoken to them or taken a meeting with them because they did meet with them during the dignified trans because of with them at the dignified train her in her and joe biden 's incompetence that those 13 americans were killed in afghanistan by the way joe biden was checking his watch during the dignified transfer ceremony as you recall president trump put out a statement quote i want to thank the families of our great warriors who have been lost to us for the way they came together as one and thank me for attending at their request the celebration of their wonderful family members who because of the incompetence of kla harris and joe biden are no longer with us thank you for saying you wanted me to stand with you at arlington national cemetery and take pictures that it was your request not mine,0.5319,so when you hear joe biden talk about wage increases understand that your wages actually mean a lot less than they did a year ago 2.6 less to be precise average weekly earnings are down even more 3.4 percent thanks to a decline in the average work week nominal wage gains are vanishing thanks to inflation the bad inflation report turned what looked like a rally inequities on wednesday into another down day investors are probably concluding that with peak inflation more durable than expected the fed may have to raise interest rates even higher than it has already estimated that increases the odds of recession unless the fed loses its anti - inflation nerve as i have said before i think that all of these polls of economy shrunk only 28 think that there 's going to be a recession inside the next six months i think that is way low i think that is closer to 50 percent whether we get a recession or not over the course of the next six months all of this exposes the fantasy that the biden pelosi schumer policy makes a blowout spending and easy money is good for working americans as the wall street journal points out modern monetary theory combined with new entitlements were supposed to produce record growth and security instead they have produced the highest inflation in 40 years in a falling standard of living americans learned this lesson the hard way in the 1970s a new generation is having to learn it again the rich will be fine the middle class is paying the bill as always as always because if you do not have to access your cash you can just wait the market out right bitcoin is taking a hit but if you are really rich you are not telling your bitcoin so you have not taken a hit yet if however you need to access that bitcoin you got a real problem on your hands that 's what 's happening with the government of el salvador which had tied its own currency to bitcoin it could use bitcoin as a substitute currency inside its own country and that means that all of its debt is now denominated in bitcoin says the value of bitcoin falls that means that they are going to have to come up with money somewhere else there 's the possibility of an entire country defaulting on its debt now i do not think that 's going to happen i think that el salvador probably recovers i think probably somebody comes in and buys el salvador 's debt and then basically invest that bitcoin is going to go up again it makes a good currency play over the course of the next couple of years because again i do not think the bitcoin is going to zero i think bitcoin is likely to recover with that said it 's a very risky time in the market and the markets continue to fall already coming up the market is tumbling stock futures are declining thanks,0.9541,facebook is the worst of all social media platforms in terms of censorship and algorithm manipulation and i know a lot of people are always saying who uses facebook anymore but the answer is a lot of people now called meta platforms the corporate umbrella for all their different companies they have a market cap of around $ 800 billion $ 800 billion making facebook or meta one of the top six most valuable companies in the world and there are still over three billion active monthly users nobody is sharing family photos on twitter or x nobody will convinced me that elon 's rebranding of twitter to x was a good idea by the way and no one is sending up party invites over instagram facebook still has its uses as bad as it is now for sharing news but remember the good old days when it actually was a cool platform before all the censorship algorithm manipulation and bogus fact checks those were the days well was once a great platform to keep in touch with family and friends and a place to read interesting articles others shared has obviously turned into another tightly controlled corporate cog in the left 's information warfare machine at the end of 2016 about a month after the election when the fake news scare was first heating up and democrats are blaming hillary 's loss on people posting misinformation about her facebook decided to start automatically factchecking things people posted outsourcing the operation the various organizations like snopes and politifact who were granted authority to police such content so facebook itself could claim they were not censoring posts deemed to be supposedly false or sticking their nose in everyone 's business it 's trusted third - party independent fact checkers from this point on when anybody posted a link to a news story or a youtube video if it triggered a fact check the post to be completely blurred out with a notice over it claiming it 's false which also prevents it from going viral but as you know many of these fact checks are completely and obviously false of the posts they censor are accurate and true this new feature was just another way for the establishment to further suppress information they do not want people to know and the system got so out of control facebook started censoring memes making fun of democrats and joe biden for example they fact checked a meme about gas prices being high because of old joe that reads man i have not seen gas is this high since the last democrat was in office anyone who posted it had the meme automatically grayed out and it was labeled false with a note claiming gas prices were high due to generic supply issues they even fact checked the popular meme of martin luther king wearing a maga hat claiming that his political affiliation is not known like all platforms they use a content id system to automatically scan every image and video that 's uploaded and they have an entire library of meem the moderators have set to be flagged satirical articles from the babylon b even get the same fact check in order to censor their mockery of liberals another ridiculously false fact check that was integrated into facebook 's automatic system by usa today one of their trusted partners claimed it was fake news that a thug named jacob blake was armed at the time that he got himself shot by police in kenosha wisconsin he 's the thug who shooting sparked the black matter riots shortly thereafter which led to kyle rittenhouse having to defend himself when he was attacked by the angry mob anyone who posted that jacob blake was armed with a knife which he was had their posts flagged as false and penalties placed on their account not only did the police say that he had a knife on him at the time of the shooting but it could be seen on video and later during an interview with good morning america he admitted the obvious that he was armed with a knife when and police shot him but facebook tried to protect the false narrative that another unarmed black man just happened to get shot by police because of racism facebook also fact checked the true claim that donald trump made about kyle writtenhouse when he said that videos showed that he was trying to get away from the mob when they attacked him anyone who followed that story closely saw those videos which went viral that same night but facebook was censoring posts that offended britten house or showed that he acted in self - defense deeming him a supposed mass shooter in supporting or praising such individuals is violation of their terms of service writtenhouse himself was banned from facebook after his arrest so he could not even defend himself on the platform while the media democrats in congress and countless others online kept smearing him as a white supremacist in a mass murderer one of the most hilarious fake fact checks happened after cnn made joe rogan looked green when they aired a video that he had posted on his instagram announcing that he had tested positive for corona virus he was not vaccinated so the media tried to rub it in that he got sick by making him look deathly ill by drastically altering the color of his video even though he only had mild symptoms because he got the monoidal antibody treatment right away no evidence video color was manipulated in cnn news segment claimed the fact checkers but if you look at the original video he uploaded to instagram side by side with the one cnn aired which is still up on their youtube channel he looks almost as green as the incredible hulk it 's cartoonishly altered and there 's no reasonable explanation for it other than it was done on purpose just like discoloring footage of political opponents in campaign ads a common tactic to cast them in a negative light k sued the fact checkers after receiving several strikes for posting supposedly false content on her facebook page which then caused it to get demonetized just like youtube channels harming the livelihoods of content creators john stasel also sued facebook for over $ 2 million claiming that their fact checks were defamatory after they had declared that several of his post were supposedly false that of course were not but a judge dismissed his lawsuit at the end of 2022 claiming that the fact checks are only a subjective judgment about the accuracy and the reliability of assertions note the judges claims that the fact checks were subjective not objective in other words the supposed fact checks were just opinions the judge 's ruling goes on to say simply because the process by which content is assessed and a label applied is called a fact check does not mean that the assessment itself is an actionable statement of objective fact so a judge ruled the fact checks are bs but facebook is allowed to still use them to censor and suppress factual information without facing any consequences candace owen 's lawsuit was also thrown on by a judge for similar bogus reasons the fact checkers are usually just fact suppressors and in typical leftist fashion they try to mask their agenda under deceptive terms that are often usually the exact opposite of what they mean of course fact checks are just one of the many tools being used to manipulate the masses we are dealing with social media mainstream media they are indoctrinating the youth in public schools and universities corporate america is also functioning as an arm of the thought police not to mention the high priest of hollywood who use cultural marxism to influence the ideas and actions of the masses and if you have not ordered my new book the war on conservatives yet you will not be disappointed so

and check it,0.1866,"but we also convened at the president 's direction a conference call with the nation 's governors and we focused on efforts at mitigation at testing and and supplies we discussed the president 's recent approval of disaster declarations for washington and california and new york but we also assured governor 's who 've submitted major disaster declarations that we will be reviewing them in an expeditious manner to ensure the full resources the federal government are brought to bear the president wanted us to make it clear that the federal government will do whatever it takes to support an effort that is locally executed state managed and federally supported we have reiterated that to our governor 's today listened to them about their specific needs and and frankly made it clear to them that while the president has published at coronavirus gov the 15 days to slow the spread for every american and millions of americans are addressing these common - sense guidelines and to prevent the spread of the corona virus in the days ahead we made it clear to the governor 's that this president and this administration fully supports decisions that governors are making in communities and states that are particularly impacted by the spread of the corona virus and we are grateful for their efforts we also spoke to the governor 's about the importance of the legislation that is currently being negotiated on capitol hill and asked them to encourage members of the house and the senate to move very quickly the bill that is currently being negotiated the president said that he believes will be resolved soon and we are encouraged by it will speed direct payments to families the average family of four will receive $ 3,000 directly there will be payroll subsidies for small businesses around in america to keep people on the payroll while they might be required to stay home unemployment insurance benefits assistance to hospitals and major industries and we continue to urge the congress to act and and ask the governor 's to engage their delegations on the subject of testing we reiterated our thanks to states across the country that are rapidly expanding testing it at drive - through sites and at community sites and as as dr . burks just reflected because of the because of the unprecedented public and private partnership that the president initiated with our commercial labs we stand here today with three hundred and thirteen thousand tests having been completed with the test results delivered to americans and still somewhat more than 41,000 have contracted corona a virus but this state - run effort is continuing to receive the full support of our team at fema and at the us public health service we are deploying personnel we are deploying resources and testing is literally expanding around the country by the hour as doctor burse also mentioned the fda has been in the process of reviewing less invasive methods of testing the president and i both reflected on the fact that that we have been tested and we have been working with the fda to to make it possible for self collected nasal swabs where individuals could at the end of their nasal passage collect a sample and i am pleased to report that that self collected swabs can now be collected in clinics and it drive through testing sites this will expedite the testing process of course but it will also reduce the risk to healthcare providers and for exposure to the corona virus and it will minimize the drain on personal protective equipment with the current test that goes pretty significantly up the nasal passage people have to wear gear and then change out the gear in this new self - administered will actually not require the drain on on personal protective equipment and it 's all a part of our effort as as admiral pol of check will discuss in just a few moments to meet the supply needs that we have across the country but but to meet them with efforts at conservation as well on the subject of testing it 's important to remember as the old book says it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick and so if you do not have symptoms you do not need to get a coronavirus test we encourage every american to adhere to that so that the testing resources are available for people that are symptomatic we also will be issuing today from health and human services new guidance to direct all commercial labs to prioritize testing for hospitalized patients and that guidance is going out tonight we also reminded the governor 's today that all state laboratories all hospital laboratories are now required by law to report the results of coronavirus tests to the cdc on the subject of supplies in our meeting today at fema we received a report of the new supply chain stabilization task force rear admiral john paul of check is leading that up at fema and the task forces is working to identify medical supplies that exist in the marketplace today to evaluate the national stockpile and also working with industries around the country to produce even more of the critical medical supplies and as the president said businesses across america are stepping up and maybe as never before in our history 3 m in fact has diverted 500,000 n95 masks from commercial customers and they are being delivered today to new york and seattle facebook we would acknowledge has donated their emergency reserve of over seven hundred thousand and ninety - five mass to health care workers and these are just a few examples of the generosity of businesses we are also seeing companies step forward repurpose their manufacturing facilities to create ventilators to create equipment and i know i speak for the president when i say how grateful and proud we are for that we also discussed with the governor 's a real breakthrough on the availability of ventilators we called on the governor 's to serve at all survey all outpatient surgical centers and hospital operating rooms because surgical ventilators that acini anesthesiologists use because of an fda decision rendered this last weekend those can be easily converted now to ventilators that can be used for people struggling with severe illness from the coronavirus and so we called on our governor 's in conversations with state leaders to survey all of their surgical centers and hospital operating rooms to identify that equipment and with the new fda guidelines they will be able to convert those to meet help meet the needs of ventilators across the country we are now eight days into the president 's 15 days to slow the spread and the american people are rising to the challenge we are doing this but in the days that remain between now and the end of the 15 days we are going to need every american to take this seriously listen to your state and local health authorities where there may be additional and stronger guidance in areas where the coronavirus spread has been more severe but for every american know that the part that you do that your family does that you do in your community to put into practice these principles of social distancing using a drive - thru at the local restaurant will make an enormous difference in in lowering the trajectory of the corona virus spreading across our country it 's going to take all of us but with the ongoing cooperation of the american people with compassion with the ingenuity of american industry with dedicated leadership at the state and federal level i know that we can slow the spread we can protect our most vulnerable and we will heal our land [ music ] thank you mr . vice president so i am very animal john polo check i am a supply chain task force lead at fema my task is to increase the supply of critical medical supplies which include personal protective equipment and ventilators items like that i just want to take a few moments to explain the organization that we have stood up this week in the last few days and our approach so you have a chart behind",0.5894,uh so parents right to know a local educational agency receiving funds under this part shall ensure that each elementary school and secondary schools serve by such agency posts on a publicly accessible website or of the school or if the school does not operate a website widely disseminates to the public a summary notice of the right of parents to information about their children 's education as required under this act which shall be in an understandable format for parents and include at a minimum the right to review and make copies of at no cost the curriculum of their child 's school the right to meet with each teacher of their child not less than twice during each school year the right to review the budget including all revenues and expenditures of their child 's school the right to a list of books and other reading materials available in the library of their child 's school and inspect such books or other reading materials the right to address the school board of the local educational agency so obviously that 's what the bill does whoever is opposed to the bill is taking the opposing position on all of those points or at least some of them so to be opposed to this bill is to say that parents should not have the right to review the curriculum and parents should not have the right to know what books their children are being assigned and parents should not have the right to meet with the teachers and address the school board uh where their child goes to school parents should not have the right to know what 's going on at school neither should they have the right to speak to anyone at the school or to anyone who runs the school this is the position of those opposed to this legislation but the bill covers more ground than just that it also gives parents the right to know if their child is being bullied at school or if the child has expressed suicidal thoughts at school or if the child has been caught with drugs and also this quote parents have the right to know if a school employee or contractor acts to change a minor child 's gender markers pronouns or preferred name or allows a child to change the child 's sex - based accommodations including locker rooms or bathrooms again consider the inverse proposition consider what the opponents are saying parents do not have the right to know if their child is suicidal or being bullied or using drugs parents do not have the right to know if their child is gender dysphoric or has started identifying as the opposite sex parents do not have the right to even know what name their child is using they are saying the school employees should have more information about a child 's mental health than the parents have this is the actual position of the democrats who took to the house floor yesterday to stridently oppose this bill using a range of tactics of course starting as always with the trusty straw man approach listen stream mega republicans do not want the children of america to learn about the holocaust do not we want our children to be kind do not we want our children to know that slavery was wrong as i fight against slavery today that still exists do not we want our children to understand the basis of all of our history the mosaicness of this nation and african - american history do not we want teachers to get the salaries that they deserve,0.6135,but this guy has a long record of this sort of thing the reason people are turning to the rhetoric question is because they can not turn to the gun control question the reason they can not turn to the gun control question is because new zealand law is some of the most heavily gun controlled on planet earth murders are rare in new zealand reports the new york times gun homicides are even rarer there were 35 murders countrywide in 2017 since 2007 gun homicides have been in the single digits every year except 2009 but there are plenty of guns there were 1.2 in registered firearms in the country of 4.6 million people in 2017 which just goes to show you that high levels of gun ownership do not necessarily mean high levels of gun violence it depends who owns the gun new zealand law allows any person age 16 or older with an entry level firearm license to keep any number of common rifles and shotguns most guns can be purchased without being tracked by law enforcement officials with that said there are still some very heavy gun control regulations in new zealand 's virtually every person who owns a firearm has to be registered the media is trying to turn this into a gun control debate but the fact is that the that compared to the united states their gun control is pretty serious it 's pretty serious so potential gun owners in new zealand have to pass a police background check for example the gun laws in australia were tightened following a 1996 mass shooting in which 35 people were killed by a lone gunman in tasmania within two weeks australian lawmakers banned rapid - fire rifles and shotguns and introduced tighter laws governing ownership of other weapons new zealand has some of these laws on the books and of course they have an incredibly low murder rate so this is really not about gun control nonetheless what you are seeing from some people is a call for gun control you are also seeing people trot out their slogans at the wrong time so one of the big things that happens in the united states is whenever there is a massacre of some sort people immediately say that their thoughts and prayers are with the folks who are hurt which is a way of expressing empathy are not we told that in politics and in life sympathy and empathy are good things and if i say that i am praying for people who just lost loved ones that that is my expression of care for them and yet it has become a thing in the united states that if you say thoughts and prayers what that really is is a way of you avoiding the harder discussions about policy and rhetoric there 's only one problem this was a massacre carried out at a mosque where people were legitimately praying because they wanted to be in consonance with something higher than themselves that 's a nonstop alexandra ocasio cortes very fresh and very face from tweeting out quote at first i thought of saying imagine being told your house of faith is not safe anymore but i could not say imagine because of charleston pittsburgh sutherland springs what good are your thoughts and prayers when they do not even keep the pews safe what the hell does she even mean by that these were muslims religious muslims praying to allah they were there to pray they were there to commune with something greater what good are your thoughts and prayers when they do not even keep the pew safe this is a fundamental misunderstanding of what religion does religion does not suggest that if you pray you will be safer religion suggests that if you pray you may become better because you are thinking about something greater than yourself and then she tries to walk this absolute crap back she says this is a time of great vulnerability for our communities we must come together fight for each other and stand up for neighbors isolation dehumanizing stereotypes hysterical conspiracy theories in hatred ultimately lead to the anarchy of violence we can not stand for it,0.6653
i am not a morosa but he it turns out like everyone who 's had an interaction with a trump including his closest allies like his personal lawyer and staff members take some precaution and want to make sure that they create their own record of an interaction with the present so i had that concern going on i had the concern going on even if he it 's an innocuous conversation for five or ten minutes and that later came out that the sitting president was talking to the local united states attorney with jurisdiction over various things at the same time the people were filing their emoluments clause civil suit and calling for investigation of other things whether there have merit or not if it later came out that preet bharara and donald trump were having these side conversations that are really not usual or typical at all and there was no documentation of what the conversations were about how is that going to look not just for me how 's it going for the president it 's not going to look very good so we consulted with protocols and thought well in the absence of knowing what it 's about probably we should not i know i should not speak to him and what also is lost on a lot of folks who just say you know you are fired disgruntled guy and linger obnoxious and rude not to return the call the president i called jeff sessions office before i made a final decision and he was not there and i talked to his his chief of staff jodi hunt and i had a frank conversation with jodi hunt he was very clear to me that no one else at the justice department no one just berman knew that the president was calling me or why he was calling me and that 's also weird and should for a normal person raise red flags and he agreed with me that not knowing what 's going on again again for the protection of the president and the white house probably best to say unless you know what it 's about unless it can be you know arranged through proper channels and when jeff sessions is back in town it 's the wise thing not to talk directly to the present and the other thing is hanging over all of this which people maybe forget when they say well the president does not know protocols and he 's just being the kind of guy he is he does you know how you know he knows about protocols and why it 's it 's it 's damaging and potentially disastrous for politicians and law enforcement people to talk offline when there 's a pending case because he campaigned on that issue again and again and again at rally after rally after rally ringing in my ears when he kept making the point that loretta lynch sitting on an airplane on the tarmac at an airport got a surprise visit from then former president bill clinton who 's why hillary clinton was under investigation by the same justice department the reta lynch was leading and you know what it 's it you know the earth exploded rhetorically and otherwise when they had their meeting and donald trump said and a lot of people agree with this you know it 's not a completely unfair point i think he overstated it a lot and i believe the integrity of loretta lynch and i believe they would not have had an untoward conversation about the investigation donald trump went to rally after rally after rally saying about a private offline conversation between loretta lynch and bill clinton obviously that must have been a thing about hillary clinton obviously that 's a corrupt conversation although no record exists of that conversation and i am thinking to myself now the president is calling me not quite the same situation,0.1153,the donald trump donald trump swore to serve when he was elected and that he can not continue to be part of a donald trump administration that has separated itself from the donald trump agenda and he should know because he is donald trump according to an anonymous made - up sources at the new york times a former newspaper the trouble began after trump made a speech on afghanistan at fort myers that was well received by the press the next day however trump went to phoenix where he let fly with a barn turner calling the press out for their dishonesty and bias fort myers trump then tweeted that phoenix trump had undermined trump 's good reviews by alienating the press just when they were being nice to trump whereupon phoenix trump angrily tweeted back that fort myers trump had sold out to the elite globalist chardonnay sipping conservatives represented by his daughter ivanka trump 's slur against trump 's daughter infuriated trump who tweeted back that trump was a loser whereupon trump responded by giving himself the nickname lion trump and then struck back with a tweet saying that trump 's ratings on the apprentice were never really as good as he said they were trump called this personal attack on himself rude which trump replied was just sad after which sources within the white house told the times that trump stopped talking to himself although whether that was out of anger or because of new medication no one was really sure rumors have swirled within the administration that it was chief of staff john kelly who forced trump out because he do not want trump to have undue influence on himself or start feeding himself conspiracy theories from infowars or recipes from marthastewart.com others within the administration maintain that the rumors of the feud are fake news ginned up by a biased press and that in fact trump left the administration on good terms with himself one thing everyone agrees on however is that with trump gone the trump administration will finally rise above the chaos that has dogged its first months and really get down to the business of carrying out trump 's agenda which they will proceed to do just as soon as ivanka tells them what it is trigger warning i am andrew klavan and this is the andrew klavan show [ music ] your life [ music ] amazing it 's a wonderful day,0.4542,so the problem then with equity as they are pushing it is someone 's race or gender does not mean they are going to be good at their job it does not mean they are to be personable it does not mean anyone 's going to want to work with them it does not mean they are going to the skills required to actually perform what needs to be done at this company so what people have brought up to me is there there 's a problem here what we are seeing is a massive walkout of google across the world and that means google now has enough people to disrupt the company who care more about ideology than the functioning of the business and do not get me wrong you need to have people who care about the community and you need to have people who care about the workload but it seems now that the push is being made for people who care more about ideology than work this can only punish google now in my opinion why do these companies keep doing this why do they get away with it because it 's hard to punish google for things like this when their profit margin is so damn high and they have a near monopoly on online advertising because of that google might lose revenue they might lose stock value but for the most part they are still profitable and they are going to succeed this creates room for people to protest things like this and demand arbitrary things like a certain person of a certain color in a certain position what i find to be most interesting about all of this is the fact that what we are seeing at google typically resembles what you see at colleges walk out protests sure sometimes people strike they make demands of their workplace but these are ideological demands for the most part and not compensatory demands these are not people who are saying things like we deserve more wages these are things like time 's up and workers rights are women 's rights they are advocating for ideological goals and not making more money or bettering their lives or getting more rights from the workplace sure they want some changes that make sense 100 % but for the most part it looks like this protest culture that we have seen emerging at colleges has now made its way into google for instance and google is a company that will live or die by its business google can not adopt ideological positions that cause it to lose money otherwise it will cease to function cnn says that google ceo sundar pichai has voiced his support for the walkouts we let googlers know that we are aware of the activities planned for thursday and that employees will have the support they need if they wish to participate pichai said in a statement to cnn on wednesday employees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward we are taking in all of their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action i think there are real concerns for what goes on with sexual harassment the workplace apparently there are a lot of executives who got huge payouts and were able to leave the company following the accusations made against them some of them are pretty serious and i think protests over that are fine and warranted but the equity demands are where it gets really interesting because i mentioned it 's kind of like we are seeing this ideological protest culture of colleges now affecting major international business you have to realize that google 's ideology is extremely relevant to politics we know for a fact that google often shows left - leaning content in search results simply because that 's what people end up seeing but google is putting forth an initiative to show more real news on youtube and that means alternative creators will pay the price and will suffer because of it youtube is trying to get rid of what they call the fringes if google is facing these kinds of protests where people are making ideological demands if they want certain people of certain ideologies at every level of the company it 's not about what 's best for the company it 's about spreading their politics throughout the company and then when you have people at a high enough position who hold these ideologies that will come out through the product and will have a huge impact on the rest of our country but another thing that i think is particularly relevant to talk about is how these protests are affecting foreign cultures and in a sense disrespecting them look you can not assume that what people believe in london or new york is the same thing that people will believe in singapore or other countries people from different places of the world have different belief structures and different cultures but because google is a massive multinational billion - dollar corporation when things happen internally at google where admittedly most people who work there are going to be wealthy or wealthy ish they spread these ideas through the internal communications and now have a huge impact on the culture of foreign countries where people are working say in singapore ultimately what i think is most interesting about this google protest is just that ideology is becoming more important than a functioning business back in the day it was all about meritocracy,0.1883,so let us get into this as we continue uh to live through this never - ending groundhogs day rioting and looting broke out in yet another city this weekend black lives matter protesters in uh big scare quotes there in kenosha wisconsin burned pillaged destroyed stole all in the name of justice of course here 's what some of that looked like take a look rioters also burned an entire car dealership so you can take a look at the footage there [ music ] and i think by far one of the most disturbing incidents from this round of rioting and really any of the rioting we have seen is the apparent attempted murder of a police officer who was hit directly in the head with a brick during the melee he got bricks now the rationalization the excuse being offered for this latest round of of rioting uh in chaos is the police shooting of a man named jacob blake on sunday at this point not much is known about the circumstances surrounding the shooting but we will show you now the video that has gone viral and prompted um allegedly all of this widespread writing now media reports indicate that police arrived on the scene in response to a domestic disturbance they tried to arrest blake who resisted even after a taser was used on him blake then walked around his car with multiple officers putting their weapons at him as you saw then he opened his door and reached inside and he was shot seven times at that point he 's currently alive though in critical condition neighbors claim that blake was trying to break up a fight between two women after the before the cops showed up that has not been confirmed but uh it does appear that blake um that there were multiple warrants out for blake for for multiple alleged crimes were cops arresting him because of his involvement in the disturbance or because of the warrants that were out from or both uh who knows apparently blake has had other violent run - ins with police as well including an incident in 2015 when he had to be subdued by a canine unit after pulling a gun at a bar now it 's not clear again whether police on the scene on sunday knew about his violent history or his warrants or anything else what we are left with for now is a man who chose not to comply with lawful orders instead opened his car door and leaned inside even as police guns were pointed at him at point - blank range as always the dearth of evidence and context has not stopped the media protesters politicians from leaping to drastic and firm conclusions the governor of wisconsin tony evers has already tied the case to racism and essentially accused the officers of carrying out a racist hit on an innocent man evers tweeted in part tonight jacob blake was shot in the back multiple times in broad daylight in kenosha wisconsin kathy and i joined his family friends and neighbors and hoping earnestly that he will not succumb to his energy injuries while we do not have all the details yet what we know for certain is that he is not the first black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country i have said all along that although we must offer our empathy equal equally important is our action in the coming days we will demand that uh just that our elected officials in our state who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long okay needless to say a decent human being who is interested in providing leadership rather than intentionally fanning the flames of anarchy would never use phrases like mercilessly and racism to describe an officer - involved shooting before he even has the details by his own admission but tony evers is not a decent human being or a leader um or a good man i mean these are really bad people that are doing this that are intentionally causing chaos and rioting even after he knows that one of his police officers was nearly killed the people you know in the media and politics encouraging the chaos that again has nearly killed a kenosha police officer also are not decent or good people putting the politics and narrative aside them what should we really think about this situation you know well the first thing we should keep in mind is that we have only heard one side of the story and there 's quite a lot we still do not know here 's a rather significant detail that 's being treated as irrelevant somehow did blake have a gun in his car media is reporting that he was unarmed but they do not appear to have any firm basis for that characterization blake went back to his car for something for some reason right was it to retrieve a firearm he has a history of pulling guns did he try it again here if he did then case closed no honest person could possibly claim that a police shooting is unjustified when the suspect is reaching for a gun to use against the officers but what if there was no gun then we are back to the original question why was blake going to his car and reaching inside could there be any plausible or even imaginable innocent reason to resist arrest walk to your car as police point their guns at you and tell you to stop and then open your door and reach inside is there a version of this story where blake 's actions are justified or innocuous i can not see what that version would be and more important than how i see this or how you see it we have to ask whether the police on the scene had good reason to suspect that blake was reaching into his vehicle to grab a weapon the answer there is without question yes again why else would he be reaching into his car in that situation if you can scarcely come up with an innocent reason as you sit pondering it on your couch out of harm 's way how can we expect the officers to imagine an innocent reason while they are in the thick of it and even if they could imagine an innocent reason are they expected to assume that his actions are innocent and stake their own lives on that gamble you know anyone who does not understand why police would want to prevent you from reaching into your car during an arrest need only watch this dash cam video from a highway stop in pennsylvania for that for clarification on the matter and just a warning it 's very graphic here but i think this is important because it 's it 's additional context for the way police are looking at this look at this okay sir,0.5858,"and they swivel how they actually govern george w bush came into office pledging to be an isolationist and then 911 happened barack obama came into office pledging to be an isolationist and then he involved us in a bunch of middle eastern conflict donald trump came into office pledging to be an isolationist and then he broker the abraham accords and took pretty harsh stances against russia and china joe biden came into office pledging that he was going to get out of afghanistan and make america less involved in the world and now there are two major ongoing wars in the world in which the united states has indirect involvement so in other words joe biden never really had the opportunity to be full on left wi when it came to foreign policy because being the president of the united states basically forestalls that his one attempt at doing that which was the disastrous pull out from afghanistan cratered his presidency if you look at his approval ratings throughout his presidency joe biden 's approval ratings dramatically sank in the aftermath of the afghanistan po and they have never recovered they have remained in the low 40s ever since all of which means that if joe biden had come into office and then govern as he pledged he was going to govern as a left - wing moderate a liberal moderate somebody who sought consensus somebody who was just going to restore a sense of normaly and moderation to american politics he would not now be in the dire straits that he is moderates have fallen off the bandwagon independents are now looking at trump and by the polling data a plurality of independence favor donald trump over joe biden right now which is why donald trump is up in the polling against joe biden how joe biden loses independence to donald trump is an amazing story because again independence are very off - put by donald trump on a personal level they voted against him in 2020 late breaking independent voters in 2016 voted 2 to1 for donald trump in 2020 late breaking independent voters voted 2 to one for joe biden and now they are shifting back to trump there 's only one reason for that and that is that joe biden allowed his ambitions to be a historic president that they would make statues of to overcome his good political sense he do not want to be a clintonian third way president he wanted to be like barack obama he wanted to be somebody who people thought of for generations to come as a transformative president in american history and because of that he has now alienated the actual base that he once held and that base is now looking much more seriously at president president trump as his rival and that means that he is enthrall to the crazies and that is the story of what happened in michigan last night again when you look at these statistics what you see is that joe biden won approximately 618,000 votes first of all that 's a very large number of votes for an incumbent president in a in a primary if you go back to like 2012 and you look at the michigan primary in 2012 for the democrats what you will see is that barack obama in the michigan primaries in 2012 when he was the incumbent president which would be the same position as as joe biden right now he only won about 174,000 votes in other words no one showed up to vote in those primaries why did no one show up to vote in the primaries because everybody kind of was like whatever who cares he 's going to be the nominee why am i even bothering to show up but for joe biden a lot of people showed up 618,000 people showed up to vote for joe biden but the bigger story of course is that 101,000 people showed up and voted uncommitted and there was an overt attempt again by the crazies in michigan led by people like rashida talib to jack up the number of people who voted uncommitted another 23,000 voted for marann williamson another 20,000 voted for dean phillips so joe biden ends up winning about 81 % of the vote total in michigan but again that big story is going to be the uncommitted voters because the idea is that if those uncommitted voters decide not to vote for joe biden in the actual election in november then he could very well lose the state now he won that state by about 150,000 votes last time 100,000 is a lot of votes are all those people going to vote actively against joe biden probably not but say half of those people decide that they are not going to show up to the polls for joe biden because they are unhappy with joe biden well that means that he 's in real trouble in michigan which means again when you steer away from the middle that means you are more reliant on your remaining voting base and his remaining voting base is full of crazy people and that is why you are seeing joe biden constantly embracing crazy unpopular positions i mean the reality is that the polling data suggest that when it comes to for example the israel hamas conflict the american people are broadly supportive of israel the latest harvard harris poll shows that 82 % of americans say they support israel more than kamas all the kamas voters are in the democratic party 68 % of americans say that israel is trying to avoid civilian casualties in fighting its war with hamas so in other words there 's pretty heavy support america remains a very pro - israel country but not inside the crazy wing of the democratic party and that 's the part that joe biden has made himself totally dependent upon and we should understand that that democratic party that the crazies in the democratic party they do not even know they are crazy that is the thing to understand about crazy people in general crazy people in general do not know that they are crazy they think that they are perfectly sane and you are crazy these folks are nuts and they can not even tell that they are nuts they deny the level of the nuttiness joe biden does too joe biden pretends this is all normal politics as usual it is not it is not normal politics as usual to have 100 th000 people vote against

certainly can establish military control over the gaza strip it will be a counterinsurgency and military control over the gaza strip for the foreseeable future how do i know that israel can do that because that 's literally what they have been doing in janine and nablus and kron and so many other cities in the west bank for literally three generations because as it turns out you sometimes have to go and kill terrorists in areas that foster terrorism and handing those areas off to other forms of regime has not exactly been a boon to israel so yes israel can achieve victory the biden administration is actively attempting to undermine that victory by redefining victory to israel is going to exterminate the ideology of kamas there 's literally no way to do that because the civilian population in gaza agrees with hamas the biden administration whenever they say this sort of stuff they are admitting the quiet part out loud which that the real problem in the middle east is that you have a radicalized population that hates jews that is the real problem in gaza this is not a situation like aan actually where you have a fairly moderate population presided over by a tyrannical terrorist group this is a situation where the terrorist group is largely supported by the civilian population but politico reports that the bid administration is attempting to undermine even the concept of victorious war here every time a senior aid of president joe biden talked about how israeli weapons can not destroy hamas 's ideology or describe the need for a day after plan they are obliquely making a point that israel 's goal of an absolute victory is out of reach the officials said so they they keep pushing israel for some sort of governance plan afterward the problem of course is that the one the one possible durable governance plan for the gaza strip is the one the united states is pushing against it also happens to be the one governance plan that was never tried meaning israel handed over the gaza strip to the palestinians in 2005 they promptly elected kamas hamas promptly killed the members of the palestinian authority and established tyrannical rule the population supports them hides them joins with them how in mesed is hamas in the infrastructure of the gaza strip they are so ined that yesterday israel released footage of kamas openly working with the united nations you can see these are un marked vehicles directly next to the un marked vehicles are hamas terrorists these are hamas terrorists carrying weapons interacting with people from the un vehicles pretending that the un and kamas are two separate entities in the gaza strip is a lie it is not true the un and hamas are one and the same the unrwa is another name for kamas they all work together pretending otherwise is ridiculous and so when the biden administration says they want a transition plan what they actually really want is hamas or its allies back in control which israel can never allow that is the real impass here the biden administration wants to please its leftwing base by suggesting that israel can not quote unquote occupy the gaza strip main maining a military presence so as to protect your own citizenry is not in fact a quote unquote occupation there is no right to establish a terror state there is no right to establish a regime that is pro- extermination of jews that is not there 's no please name me the moral or international right to do this thing it does not exist and yet the biden administration keeps suggesting that somehow it 's israel 's job to prop up people that want to destroy it which is totally insane in fact the times of israel reported yesterday that the us appears to be laying the groundwork for declaring that israel has already weakened kamas sufficiently to justify an end to the war what exactly does that mean apparently the united states has signaled its tepid support for china 's recent efforts to strike a long elusive deal between hamas and fata which is the military arm of the palestinian authority that would likely mean a degree of hamas approval of the individuals tap to lead the transitional palestinian government in gaza but the american source said no kamas members would be allowed in the government that 's ins that is hamas launches war against israel gets their asses kicked and then the united states is like wait how about if hamas picked the government of the pa and then the pa ruled gaza so that 's the united states actively standing for a terrorist coalition to run gaza well funding both sides of the war which is nuts it 's nuto get some more on this in a moment,1.1665,"would those who support the legislation think that 's a good thing or would they be dismayed bad actors have already weaponized some of sensible equality laws for their own benefit but it 's not just republicans this is actually a huge debate in the feminist community this story from pj media lesbian feminist slams the equality act hr 5 is a human rights violation on tuesday lesbian feminist julia beck who was kicked off of the baltimore lgbt commission because she opposes transgender identity testified against the federal equality act her testimony caused quite a stir with many democrats expressly asking other witnesses to delegitimize it if the act passes in its current form as hr 5 then every right that women have fought for will cease to exist to bec warrant hr 5 is a human rights violation every single person in this country will lose their right to single sex sports shelters grants and loans the law will forbid ever distinguishing between women and men they add beck warned male rapists will go to women 's prisons and likely assault female inmates as has already happened in the uk female survivors of rape will be unable to contest male presence in women 's shelters men will dominate women 's sports girls who would have taken first place will be denied scholastic opportunity women who use male pronouns to talk about men may be arrested fined and banned from social media platforms girls will stay home from school when they have their periods to avoid harassment by boys in mixed space toilets girls and women will no longer have a right to ask for female medical staff or intimate care providers including elderly or disabled women who are at serious risk of sexual abuse female security officers will no longer have the right to refuse to perform pat downs or intimate searches of males who say they are female and women undergoing security checks will no longer have the right to refuse having those security checks being performed by men claiming a feminine identity everything i just listed is already happening and it 's only going to get worse if gender identity is recognized in federal law i urge my fellow democrats to wake up please acknowledge biological reality becca concluded after her testimony representative jerry nadler chairman of the house committee on the judiciary asked son who chandi legal director of the national women 's law center and a pro transgender witness to contradict beck 's testimony listening to that testimony it seems like that particular witness does not believe that transgender people exist chandi responded i find this response to be entirely disingenuous and there is a legitimate argument to counter back statements just because there are people who exploit the system and just because the media covers stories does not mean they are actually as big of a problem as we think they are now it 's true they may be a problem and it 's also true this might be over height it requires an actual deep look at statistics and what is actually going on now i am not saying this to discredit back i am just offering up a legitimate criticism of the things she 's bringing up simply coming out and saying it sounds like beck does not think transgender people exist in no way actually argues what she 's saying this is one of the biggest battles happening on the left right now and there is no middle ground i have been called a sexist by both sides trans inclusionary and trans exclusionary i have been called a trans folk a woman hater there 's just no way to appropriately respond to this if you think that trans women should not be competing it 's biological females you are transphobic if you think people have a right to use whatever language they want on social media without being banned you are transphobic however when i actually say that i think trans people are deserving of civil rights protections then i am called sexist by other feminists there 's quite literally no way to be correct in this matter because both sides do not like what you have to say about it even if you are just trying to explain it but there are some interesting problems that will arise with the loose and vague definition of gender identity so naturally this is going to land me on the turf side of the argument i suppose but it 's important to point out so let us point it out anyway first important to note that many of these women 's only school programs actual already are illegal it 's just that no one 's challenged them so they are not being shut down but there are some people who are actively challenging them now here 's where it gets kind of confusing if anyone can identify as any gender they want personally i do not think you are going to see a a massive wave of people just deciding to join women 's sports but cheaters do exist and when you tell someone a college scholarship is on the line you may find that some people decide cheating is worth getting $ 100,000 worth of school education or whatever the scholarship is worth yeah they might actually cheat the definition does not require anyone to undergo hormone therapy or to be formally diagnosed you can just say you are trans or a woman and then you have immediate access to spaces typically designed to protect females or you have programs designed to encourage women in certain areas actually get shut down like this story from the grand forks herald rules for women only grants changed after man 's discrimination charge at university of minnesota this is from last november as it is already illegal to discriminate based on someone 's gender identity is less relevant to what we are already seeing right now but this story shows us the strange contradiction held by intersectional feminists this story from the college fix to protect illegal women only lounge hundreds of women and some men promised to squat michigan state university had a study lounge that was off - limits to men for 91 years until a professor from a rival school filed a regulatory complaint the media noticed and poof the lounge was suddenly open to all genders because of this five hundred students including a smattering of men have promised to squat in the lounge with another 400 interested as of monday night the event take back the wins lounge said we must join together to take back our safe space adding this will be an intersectional event and it has come to my attention that women of different identities have previously felt uncomfortable in the women 's lounge so i wanted to make an additional effort to make the space open and inclusive to women of all identities now this may be the best example of why the equality act will fail in many regards so long as gender identity is so vaguely defined at this school they wanted a space for women only however there are also trans women thus they needed to make the space intersectional meaning it would include trans women as well but how do you define what makes a woman a woman that 's been something of great debate even among the intersectional feminists because you might actually have someone who identifies as a woman a biological female who wears a tailored suit like a three - piece suit well that 's a traditionally masculine role and they are embracing it but it does not mean they are not a woman so what happens then when someone wears i do not know just clothes like i am wearing walks in and they say we fought for the rights to have a women 's only space you can not come in could i then just say i am a woman and they have to let me in more importantly do they have the right to challenge me or anyone else to ask us whether or not we are actually women while i think it would be exceedingly rare that someone would lie and pretend to be trans just to get access to a lounge it 's also important to point out that anybody in the lounge has no right to even challenge you because think about the ramifications of that someone could show who 's legitimately trans and then be forced to show their papers or prove they are trans",0.4054,but it 's sort of a last - ditch bid by team trump to stop the certification of the election according to cnbc 17 states whose elections were won by president trump told the supreme court on wednesday they support a texas attorney general ken paxton 's bid to file a lawsuit that could effectively reverse biden 's projected electoral college victory the filing backing pacson by the states came a day after he asked the supreme court for permission to georgia michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin all of which biden purportedly won over their voting processes later on wednesday trump filed a motion to intervene in the case in his personal capacity as a presidential candidate these states are basically saying that if other states vote unfairly they are being deprived of equal protection under the law so texas is basically saying for example that if pennsylvania screws up its voting procedure it outweighs our ability to vote fairly so we voted fairly they voted unfairly therefore democrats stole that and therefore we have a stake in the national election it 's a hard legal argument to make the the 17 former officials and lawmakers filed their own brief supporting these the the four swing states they said the constitution does not make the supreme court the multi - district litigation panel for trials of presidential election disputes so in other words states get to make their own voting procedures and other states can not sue those states for their voting procedures this was actually just an attempt to elevate this thing to the supreme court that was really the idea here because again under the under the constitution then controversies between states are typically adjudicated by the supreme court or can be adjudicated by the supreme court but for a controversy to arrive between the states you actually have to make a plausible federal claim most legal experts think that this thing is basically doomed to failure andy mccarthy who is an ally of president trump 's and has been a big defender of trump throughout his administration he has a piece over at national review pointing out that this lawsuit is unlikely to go anywhere he says the first thing to notice about texas 's lawsuit is what does not appear on the front page the name of the state 's solicitor general kyle hawkins the lawsuit is brought against four other states thus attorney general ken paxton invokes the original jurisdiction of the u.s supreme court to hear disputes between the states but the brief is not signed by the lawyer who typically represents texas when there is a supreme court case that 's because this thing has no prospect of winning according to andy mccarthy he says there 's a lot to be said for texas 's complaint as a political polemic it 's true democrats labor mightily to undermine election integrity the only rational reason for that is to make it easier for legally unqualified people to cast ballots and to cast them in bulk the ballots of people would not otherwise have voted it 's also true mail and voting on a massive scale creates tremendous potential for fraud this potential is inevitably realized and at least some fraud when coupled with other policies that democrats like by getting rid of i 'd or signature verification witness requirements ballot harvesting all of these matters should be addressed by congress and by state lawmakers says andy mccarthy but none of them give state the texas the standing to sue other states over the manner in which they do elections again in order to have a case or controversy you have to demonstrate standing then you have to show that you have been damaged right if colton gets hit by a car i can not sue the person who drove the car on behalf of colton i do not have standing colton members of colton family would have to sue presumably says annie mccarthy this does not mean the flouting of election laws by officials in pennsylvania and other states is not a serious issue it means that if texas wants to raise that issue the supreme court is not the right forum to report to repeat a point i have made before the court did not grant review of a case from pennsylvania it should have taken involving a narrow critical issue of constitutional law pertaining to elections when that issue was raised by parties in the commonwealth who were directly affected the justices are not going to have interest in entertaining a sprawling lawsuit brought by an unaffected third party state he says he thinks that in all likelihood they are just going to throw this thing out it 's also a problem because it actually creates the the legal predicate if the supreme court were to take it it would actually create the legal predicate for any state suing another state for any supposed impact on the first state so for example california could sue alabama over alabama 's abortion laws saying that california provides abortion alabama does not provide abortion and therefore that affects california because people are traveling from alabama to california to have abortions and it is creating strain on their system right you could see people making those sorts of claims this is why you have pretty strict rules in terms of what is a case or controversy and what standing constitutes so it 's unlikely that this is going to go anywhere according to annie mccarthy federal law provides a procedure under which on january 6th congress will convene to count the electoral votes if texas 's elected representatives object to the counting of any state 's electoral votes congress will hear debate and vote on those objections at that point there 's no way however the supreme court will entertain that texas lawsuit so it 's important that you know that going in so that we know exactly what is coming down the road there 's still one outstanding lawsuit in georgia that one has plausible claims to make i will be fascinated to see how georgia 's secretary of state responds to very specific allegations that are made in the georgia lawsuit about not only the violation of election protocol but also about specific voters who should not have voted i mean there 's like giant lists of them included in this georgia lawsuit so that one is the one to watch in terms of lawsuits that have a chance of going anywhere,0.368,so i thought i would read you a section from the overture the introduction which describes the book 's contents in some detail beyond order 12 more rules for life why beyond order it is simple in some regard order is explored territory we are in order when the actions we deem appropriate produce the results we aim at we regard such outcomes positively indicating as they do first that we have moved closer to what we desire and second that our theory about how the world works remains acceptably accurate nonetheless all states of order no matter how secure and comfortable have their flaws our knowledge of how to act in the world remains eternally incomplete partly because of our profound ignorance of the vast unknown partly because of our willful blindness and partly because the world continues in its entropic manner to transform itself unexpectedly furthermore the order we strive to impose on the world can rigidify as a consequence of ill - advised attempts to eradicate from consideration all that is unknown when such attempts go too far totalitarianism threatens driven by the desire to exercise full control where such control is not possible even in principle this means risking a dangerous restriction of all the psychological and social changes necessary to maintain adaptation to the ever - changing world and so we find ourselves inescapably faced with a need to move beyond order into its opposite chaos if order is where what we want makes itself known when we act in accordance with our hard - won wisdom chaos is where what we do not expect or ever remain blind to leaps forward from the potential that surrounds us the fact that something has occurred many times in the past is no guarantee that it will continue to occur in the same manner there exists eternally a domain beyond what we know and can predict chaos is anomaly novelty unpredictability transformation disruption and all too often dissent as what we have come to take for granted reveals itself as unreliable sometimes it manifests itself gently revealing its mysteries and experience that makes us curious compelled and interested this is particularly likely although not inevitable when we approach what we do not understand voluntarily with careful preparation and discipline other times the unexpected makes itself known terribly suddenly accidentally so we are undone and fall apart and can only put ourselves back together with great difficulty if at all neither the state of order nor the state of chaos is preferable intrinsically to the other that is the wrong way to look at it nonetheless in my previous book 12 rules for life an antidote to chaos i focus more on how the consequences of too much chaos might be remediated we respond to sudden and unpredictable change by preparing physiologically and psychologically for the worst and because only god himself knows what this worst might be we must in our ignorance prepare for all eventualities and the problem with that continual preparation is that in excess it exhausts us but that does not imply in any manner that chaos should be eliminated an impossibility in any case although what is unknown needs to be managed carefully as my previous book repeatedly stressed whatever is not touched by the new stagnates and it is certainly the case that a life without curiosity that instinct pushing us out into the unknown would be a much diminished form of existence what is new is also what is exciting compelling and provocative assuming that the rate at which it is introduced does not intolerably undermine and destabilize our state of being like 12 rules for life the current volume provides an explication of rules drawn from a longer list of 42 originally published and popularized on the q a website quora unlike my previous book beyond order explores as its overarching theme how the dangers of too much security and control might be profitably avoided because what we understand is insufficient as we discover when things we are striving to control nonetheless go wrong around us we need to keep one foot within order while stretching the other tentatively into the beyond and so we are driven to explore and find the deepest of meanings in standing on the frontier secure enough to keep our fear under control but learning constantly learning as we face what we have not yet made peace with or adapted to it is this instinctive meaning something far deeper than mere thought that orients us properly in life so that we do not become overwhelmed by what is beyond us or equally dangerously stultified and stunted by dated too narrow or too pridefully paraded systems of value and belief what have i written about more specifically rule one describes the relationship between stable predictable social structures and individual psychological health and makes the case that such structures need to be updated by creative people if they are to retain their vitality rule 2 analyzes a centuries - old alchemical image relying on several stories ancient and modern to illuminate the nature and development of the integrated human personality rule 3 warns of the dangers of avoiding the information vital to the continued rejuvenation of the psyche signaled by the emergence of negative emotions such as pain anxiety and fear rule 4 argues that the meaning that sustains people through difficult times is to be found not so much in happiness which is fleeting but in the voluntary adoption of mature responsibility for the self and others rule 5 uses a single example drawn from my experience as a clinical psychologist to illustrate the personal and social necessity of attending to the dictates of conscience rule 6 describes the danger of attributing the cause of complex individual and social problems to single variables such as sex class or power rule 7 outlines the crucial relationship between discipline striving in a single direction and forging of the individual character capable of resilience in the face of adversity rule 8 focuses on the vital importance of esthetic experience as a guide to what is true good and sustaining in the human world of experience rule 9 makes the case that past experiences whose current recall remains laden with pain and fear can be stripped of their horror by voluntary verbal exploration and reconsideration rule 10 notes the importance of explicit negotiation to maintenance of the good will mutual regard and heartfelt cooperation without which no true romance can be sustained rule 11 opens by describing the world of human experience in a manner that explains what motivates three common but direly dangerous patterns of psychological response delineates the catastrophic consequences of falling prey to any or all of them and lays out an alternative route rule 12 finally makes the case that thankfulness in the face of the inevitable tragedies of life should be regarded as a primary manifestation of the admirable moral courage required to continue our difficult march uphill,0.2961,he 's the god the son that 's not in the bible peter said if jesus was not do not feel that what peter said was sufficient jesus would have corrected peter according to you all 's doctrine peter should have said you are god you are the second person of the trinity now if a jew growing up in jewish theology tell jesus to his face you are not the christ that means the anointed one the son of the living god you are not god you are the son of the living god you are the son of the living god jesus do not slow down he do not start still he do not question he said blessed are you flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but the father in heaven yet the father shows you who i am the father do not show peter that jesus was god the father do not show peter that jesus was a second person of the trinity 3 & 1 1 & 3 1 of 3 come on man you guys are taking scripture and using the external doctrine to fulfill your own lust some of it by purpose some of it by accident jesus clearly acknowledged and not only did he acknowledge he said that you are the rock on which i found my church whatever you loose in heaven we loose on earth he gave peter the keys to the kingdom of heaven why do not you just say what peter said why why do you got to say what somebody they ai not never seen jesus danny like what they are telling you jesus is peter just saying it right here in the bible peter just said the christ the son of the living god i can go that thousand six hundred some of you all watching is you know what you get what i am saying it 's facts see chad thanks so much for the sooc at the heavenly courts proclaim in matthew 17 1 through 5 and jesus is my beloved son and hold my well please listen to him think about this for a minute a voice from heaven said the voice for heaven should have said this is me in the form of a son believe him this is the second person of the trinity a voice from heaven said it 's my beloved son not my equal not co - equal person of the godhead said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased i am just saying you all making up stuff god do not even say that jesus was the second person of a triune,0.481,and then they move him back into his coffin and then the door shots click but here 's the problem there are a lot of democrats who are not particularly satisfied with all of this particularly because the person who is backing up joe biden is also wildly unpopular in kamala harris republicans are not just going to run against joe biden they are also going to run against the person who presumptively will pick up the pieces when god forbid something happens to the current president of the united states this is why presumably you have bernie sanders back in new hampshire over the weekend so bernie has no business in new hampshire the only reason for burning to be in new hampshire is because he thinks maybe just maybe joe biden can be around if it 's time to run for president again and everybody has talked about the gavin newsoms of the world we will get to him in a moment everybody talks about kamala harris people forget that the person who won iowa and new hampshire in the last democratic primary season was neither of those two characters kamala harris dropped out before we even hit california the person who won was bernie and if it had not been for the entire democratic party infrastructure coming together to stop bernie sanders from winning the nomination they literally all got together then they all endorsed joe biden simultaneously if that does not happen bernie sanders is the nominee for the democratic party and there is every belief that donald trump wins re - election over bernie sanders well bernie is getting active again and i got to tell you communism must be amazing for your for your blood because apparently being a complete leech on other people for your entire life which is bernie sanders 's story one of the most useless people in all of american history bernie sanders entire life has been built around useless uselessness taking american public dollars and all the he is just the worst and bernie is back in new hampshire over the weekend he delivered a speech entitled the agenda america needs at saint anselm college 's new hampshire institute of politics he said this will lay out a concrete agenda which speaks to the needs of the long neglected working class and he put out a statement saying i have always believed a good public policy is good politics the american people are increasingly disgusted at the growing levels of income and wealth and equality in our country and the rampant corporate greed we are seeing all of this is a sparking some speculation cnn 's an interview with bernie over the weekend here 's what he had to say you said if we are going to defeat the creeping authoritarianism and right - wing extremism there has to be an ideological change of course can you explain what you mean by that well what i mean by that dana is that the president has a right to be very proud of many of the accomplishments that we have achieved in the last three years unemployment very very low we brought inflation down we are investing in clean energy we are rebuilding our infrastructure uh we have made real progress in a number of areas but the reality is that today sixty percent of our people living paycheck to paycheck we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality three people or more wealth in the bottom half of america foreign this is the language of a person who wants to campaign right as new hampshire institute of politics executive director neil levesque told the christian science minor he said we invited him but he is coming here for a reason i think it opens the door for a lot of other sorts of thoughts about whether or not biden 's going to be the nominee whether or not biden is going to be running in next year 's presidential election now biden bernie has said over and over and over he 's going to back biden but again it seems as though there is now that the door is now open to democrats openly talking about what happens if joe biden does not survive and this has been sort of verboten right there 's been a kind of ixnay on the talking about joe biden 's elf,0.6273,it can not be overstated how important this message is pop culture matters what happens in front of the cameras on a soundstage and the warner brothers lot often makes more of a difference to the fate of america than what happens in the back rooms of the rayburn house office building on capitol hill it continues as it stands the frankfurt school taught left is fighting the political battle on both political and cultural battlefields conservatives are fighting it only on the political battlefield that means that art humor song theater television film dance are all devices used every day in order to influence the hearts and minds of the american people he 's talking about cultural marxism which is the practice of waging a psychological war against america in all of western civilization by relentlessly attacking every aspect of our culture symbols and institutions hoping to gradually weaken society by subverting its foundations to the point where it becomes so dysfunctional it can be overthrown and replaced by a marxist estate to accomplish this the supposed news media regularly engages in what 's called agenda - setting by hyping up certain stories and covering them ad nauseam to create the false impression that those stories are actually important because they are what people are talking about this provides a false justification for the extensive coverage creating an artificial feedback loop where they hype up a story as if it 's the talk of the town and then everyone starts talking about it because they are inundated by reports about it so the media keeps reporting on it claiming that it 's a relevant story because so many people are talking about it they carefully choose stories oftentimes of rare and isolated instances and then amplify them hoping to give the impression that there 's an epidemic and use the cherry - picked examples to promote or reinforce liberal ideologies at the same time they act as gatekeepers purposely omitting other actually important stories and events which show a side of an issue they are hoping people do not hear about or are trying to downplay the significance of the liberal media industrial complex uses their technology to influence rather than inform to attack in educate to promote certain events while pretending others do not exist they always amplify salacious allegations that feed into the one set of narratives they are pushing and then completely ignore the facts when they later come out if they prove the initial reports to be false they just carry on as if nothing happened and keep repeating the same pattern like clockwork amplifying the allegations and then ignoring the outcome the election of president trump has resulted in the american mainstream media throwing all objectivity out the window and dedicating their existence to painting him as a mentally deranged dictator who needs to be impeached or imprisoned they have gotten so bold in their attempts to overthrow our republic that they now regularly engage in gaslighting and continue to repeat easily debunked falsehoods as if they are true hoping to get people to start doubting their own memory reasoning and perception about what actually is going on this is what gaslighting is by repeatedly lying with confidence using misdirection and discounting contrary information the media causes some people to begin questioning their own version of reality the term gaslighting originates from an old 1938 play later made into a movie in 1944 where a central theme of the plot involves a woman 's husband who subjects her to all kinds of mind games trying to drive her insane including dimming the gas lamps in their home while convincing her that she 's just imagining that it 's getting darker the media insists that the name george soros is a code word for anti - semitism as our globalists and hollywood liberals the constant assertions that anyone who supports building the wall at the us - mexico border is racist and anyone who supports president trump is a white supremacist are ridiculous but are believed by gullible people who are susceptible to propaganda television news anchors lie with such assurance and being accompanied by symbols of authority like their fancy studios graphics on the surface it appears as if they are legitimate news broadcasts the 2016 presidential election proved that the balance of power had shifted from a tight - knit group of mainstream media companies into the hands of everyday americans who used facebook twitter and youtube to spread their messages to others whether it was a few hundred of their facebook friends or an audience of millions if their posts went viral so in order to regain control of the flow of information the legacy media conglomerates began working closely with the silicon valley titans to rewrite the algorithms so these popular platforms would favor their contents above that posted by ordinary people or popular social media personalities it 's an understatement to say that what 's happening is a conspiracy between various sectors of the media industry which are working together to give traditional media outlets the loudest voices online mix in google and youtube manipulating search results wikipedia being the number one source of encyclopedia articles and social media companies systematically censoring promit of conservative accounts under the disguise of combating hate speech and you have a recipe for total information control there is a reason that dictators throughout history of aim to seize the country 's media as one of their top priorities so they can use it not only to further their own aims but to prevent their opposition from using it for theirs just two weeks after the shocking loss of hillary clinton to donald trump in the 2016 election the war on fake news was launched as a smokescreen to suppress the reach of regular users social media posts and artificially boost messages from the mainstream media the democrats became frantic about the supposed fake news being shared on facebook that they claimed it cast hillary in a false light and that was the reason they said why so many people do not trust her and hence do not vote for her well there were a few fake viral news stories smearing her all of the studies show that they had no influence on people 's votes and just reinforced the beliefs they already held about her there were also fake stories about donald trump that went viral during the heat of the campaign but that fact is ignored and the fake news problem was framed as an issue that 's only one - sided in reality the fake news scare was just an elaborate ruse to dramatically alter the way social media functions by pressuring big tech companies to emphasize mainstream media outlets in people 's feeds instead of showing organically what should be there based on who they were following and what was being posted barack obama was the first social media president getting elected in 2008 when facebook was first becoming a central hub in people 's lives he was the first president to have a facebook page and a twitter account and his senior advisor david axelrod later admitted quote if not for social media barack obama would have never been elected president because it gave us the ability to connect to a new generation of voters at the time social media was kind of a novelty but a few years later it would permeate most people 's lives when everyone had to have an iphone and the social media companies released mobile apps so people could stay connected wherever they were instead of having to wait until they got home from work or school to open up their laptop to see what was happening online but today getting news online is not just a novelty it 's the norm a report from pew research in 2018 showed that more americans get their news from posts on social media than from newspapers social media now starts revolutions and overnight a single video clip can turn most of the world against a nation 's leader or galvanize members of an entire political party to rally behind a cause since the barriers to entry are now so low today with anyone being able to start a youtube channel or create a facebook page we are seeing legacy media frantically trying to stop their industry and their influence from slipping through their fingers liberals favorite tactic today is silencing their opposition under the disguise of combating hate speech or stopping right - wing extremists and the ability to censor and manipulate information online rests in the hands of just a few gigantic corporations whose values are completely opposed to middle america and traditional family values because of the emergence of social media billions of people around the world communicate through facebook twitter and other online platforms which if largely taken the place of sending emails and talking on the phone as you know today these social media apps can allow anyone 's message to spread just as far as something broadcast on the national news or printed on the front page of the new york times but because of this massive redistribution of power the liberal media industrial complex is scrambling to put the genie back in the bottle one does not have to be a social media star to be a victim of the left 's censorship because average users have their facebook posts tweets instagram pics and youtube videos removed all the time for violating community standards big texts increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems automatically scan every post for keywords that they have identified as sexist racist homophobic islamophobic anti semantics are just generally hateful or offensive and has them removed once discovered just a handful of these violations and your entire account to shut down for good and everything you have ever posted they are deleted nothing is out of the reach of their ai and anything can be deleted at any moment by the nameless and faceless moderators leaving the victims with no recourse or appeal total control of information is what they want and they have hijacked the technology we all use to communicate in our modern age but thankfully you were able to get this powerful tool into your hands before they could stop it an old - fashioned book i commend you for picking one up and tuning out the noise relentlessly trying to make its way to your ears and turning away from the millions of tweets facebook posts and video clips all competing for your attention and the coming pages we will do a deep dive into each of the major social media platforms and i will detail their algorithm manipulation double standards liberal bias and censorship we will also dissect the media 's war on president trump their mission to destroy our culture by undermining traditional family values and we will take a look at the future of fake news while scrolling through tweets and facebook posts is often like junk food for the brain reading a book is a healthy and nourishing four - course meal in comparison sure junk food is fine in moderation,0.3248,i already use it for my parents helix again helix sleep.com slash ben alrighty so the supreme court is currently considering whether to overrule roe versus wade i actually think that what the supreme court is likely to do in this particular case is uphold the mississippi law that would essentially bar abortion after the 15th week i do not think they are going to overrule rule versus wade i think you are going to end up with a split decision in planned parenthood versus casey you really never ended up with a solid majority decision he had a majority for certain principles and then you had four justices voting for one thing and four justices voting for another thing i think that what emerges from this case is likely to be a mess i think that it is not going to be something as clear as even viability which is an unclear and stupid standard i think it will be less clear than that i do not think it 's going to be the trimester framework of roe versus wade i do not know what it 's going to be i do think that we are optimistic on the pro - life side if we think that roe versus wade is going to be completely overturned even though that ought to be the outcome here and here 's the thing even if roe versus wade is overturned the law in new york is not going to be the same as the law in mississippi and everybody who studies law understands this because that was the case before roe versus wade california had some pretty liberal abortion laws new york had some pretty liberal abortion laws and texas had some pretty strict abortion laws before roe versus wade went into place nonetheless the fact that the supreme court is now considering the possibility of disestablishing a constitutional right to abortion which again does not exist it was made up out of whole cloth and an entire line of cases stretching all the way back to griswold through eisenstadt v baird all the way up through planned parenthood versus casey that supposed constitutional right to abortion was made up directly out of the colons of supreme court justices who had political leanings in favor of a pro - choice position [ music ] even if it were overruled if if ladies want to get abortions all they have to do is not be in texas and they could go over the over the border to mexico and presumably they 'd be able to get an abortion there go over to california get an abortion there listen i would prefer a nationwide regime wherein no one can get an abortion accepting cases where the mother 's life is in danger but that 's not the way the federalist system works and because of that that means that there will be state differences in how abortion law is applied but the left is losing it they are losing it and the reason they are losing it is because once you remove the constitutional right to abortion once you say that there is no constitutional right to abortion this brings back into play the rules of nature and this is something that the left has been fighting very hard as i pointed out yesterday for the left equality of outcome is the only metric of success in a society and there are certain natural barriers to equality of outcome in every arena of life and some people are taller some people are shorter some people are dumber some people are smarter one of the great obstacles to equality of outcome in life are physical differences between men and women men and women do not operate the same way their bodies do not operate the same way and women very often make choices that are dependent on their ability to bear and rear children and they they like those choices for the most part this has been the greatest superpower of women since time immemorial is that women are capable of bearing children and then feeding the children with their own body and bringing those children up and by the way when women are given the opportunity to take time off from the workforce to spend time with children they are far more likely to do so than fathers are so the the attempt to crack down on motherhood which has been an aspect of the far left has now taken over the entire left so the left used to say that abortion used to be it should be rare in in very circumscribed cases because you know it 's really a bad thing and you need to allow it to be legal because you never know something really bad could happen you might need an abortion right that used to be the case now it is a centralized aspect of femininity that abortion be there it is central to womanhood that you 'd be able to terminate your pregnancy and this is a very different position than the position that the left used to hold even as late as the 1990s pretty consistently now the position is that in order for women to achieve the same outcomes as men women have to be able to for any reason rid their bodies of a of a human life with potential and so the fact that the supreme court is now considering getting rid of the quote - unquote constitutional right to abortion means that the left has lost its mind and um and they are going to spout nonsense and craziness and and make arguments that that have no internal logic to them and this is what happened all day yesterday all day yesterday you got from the media just the craziest positions a unsustainable illogical insane immoral positions being spouted by the left on a regular basis,0.9988,she said european security and defense has evolved more in the last six days than in the last two decades brussels has moved to europeanized the efforts of member states to aid ukraine with weapons and money put down a marker for the bloc as a significant military actor but whether european weaponry will continue to reach the ukrainian battlefield in time to make a difference is far from certain it 's a strategy that risks encouraging a wider war possible retaliation from putin putin already sees nato is committed to threaten or even destroy russia through its support for ukraine that is what he has said over and over and over again and this is the excuse that putin has used all along is that these evil westerners they keep provoking me by allowing ukraine to move toward the west one of the people who 's been promoting that idea is john mearsheimer most famous for his idiotic book with stephen walt the israel lobby and u.s foreign policy in which he 'd suggested that essentially the jews control american foreign policy samir shimer also has similarly idiotic ideas with regard to russia and ukraine he did an interview with the new yorker trying to say that the west is at fault for putin 's invasion of ukraine he said i think all the trouble in this case really started in april 2008 at the nato summit in bucharest where afterward nato issued a statement that said ukraine and georgia would become a part of nato the russians made it unequivocally clear at that time they viewed this as an existential threat they drew a line in the sand nevertheless what has happened with the passage of time is that we have moved forward to include ukraine in the west to make ukraine a western bulwark on russia 's border of course this includes more than just nato expansion nato expansion is at the heart of the strategy but it includes eu expansion as well it includes turning ukraine into a pro - american liberal democracy and from a russian perspective this is an existential threat so he does not explain why that 's an existential threat why is ukraine being a liberal democracy an existential threat to russia there has not been a single attack launched as far as i am aware across the russian border by ukraine this is not like lebanon attacking israel or something a ukraine has not been used as a staging ground to attack russia russia used to occupy ukraine then the soviet union crumbled and ukraine became an independent territory at the point that ukraine became an independent country they now had the ability to ally themselves with the west if they so chose and the fact that nato already exists on russia 's border in the form of latvia and lithuania and estonia effectively why exactly would ukraine be any different mirsheimer 's suggestion that america is trying to turn countries into pro - american liberal democracies first of all even if we were i do not see the big problem i will be honest with you i am missing the part where that 's bad but second of all we are not i mean ukraine became a pro - america liberal democracy of its own accord they have had democratic elections multiple times and they have shifted sometimes they are more pro - america sometimes they are less for america if a country decides of its own accord that it wishes to ally itself with western democratic values why should russia see that as an existential threat we are not trying to overthrow the russian regime we have made no no attempts to do so more on john mirosheimer 's take that the united states is responsible for ukraine being invaded by russia which is a self - defeating and illogical take i will explain why in just one moment first you need home insurance okay by law in many states you need home insurance and finding home insurance most people do it by word of mouth which is not an efficient

western hemisphere understand this full well with regard to the united states,0.7495,atlas intel has trump up plus4 in in michigan new york times sienna has harris plus one again that 's margin of error trafalgar has trump plus two and mir 's michigan news source has trump plus one in other words these are very close states but trump seems to be picking up some momentum not only that the union men who really are prevalent in these states in michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania are turning against k harris and tim walls i mentioned this a couple of weeks ago that the teamsters union poll which showed that joe biden was beating donald trump when he was in the race among teamers union members as soon as k harris got in it flipped and suddenly trump was winning those union members 60 to 40 which leads me to my theory that there is a very large and very quiet male prot trump vote that men particularly blue collar white men look at kamla harris and they see someone who disdains traditional masculinity and the attempts to turn say doug hof into an icon of the new masculinity or tim walls the weirdo into some sort of icon of what it 's like to be a true man in america in 2024 not only is that not having its desired impact it is actually exacerbating male feelings that the democratic ticket is no longer interested in them politico has an entire piece today titled the latest union snub for harrison walls underscores a bigger problem for their campaign they point out the dem rats waning influence with unions especially industrial male heavy groups like the firefighters and the teamsters has been a major point of concern for democrats since harris took over the ticket from joe biden who is widely hailed by union leaders as a staunch ally of organized labor to fill that void harris who has a strong pro labor record but few personal ties to the country 's unions has leaned heavily on tim walls to help bolster the tickets labor appeal on the campaign trail the governor frequently talks up harris 's role in the most pro - union us administration in history under joe biden so the uaw is backing harrison walls so is the international brotherhood of electric workers but that does not mean that the members of those unions are going to vote for kamla harris and tim walls and that 's not because harrison walls are not pro - union they are in fact essentially scopin to the labor unions that is because the people who actually work and are members of unions do not necessarily vote just because they are members of unions they may have a bunch of cross - cutting concerns including concerns about what kla harris is going to do on the economy including concerns about the attack on traditional masculinity including concerns that kla harris just does not have them in her heart and there is you know a lot of good evidence to that effect which is why kla harris right now has some serious problem in these blue wall states so kamla is struggling in all the blue wall states,0.5272,and so you would think this is a good thing right there 's a good alternative and it takes enormous amounts of power away from the government this is why the government is so scared crapless of cryptocurrency they are scared so crapless of it that you are going to stop like if if cryptocurrency ever became a denomination in use not denominated in dollars but things started to be denominated in bitcoin or you started trading in bitcoin it 's not stable enough right now for people to really trade in bitcoin is one of the problems with bitcoin is that it used to be that there was this concept that bitcoin would be used in transactions right instead of paying for a car in dollars you pay for it in bitcoin the problem is because bitcoin is still volatile because not enough people buy it and use it because of that the price of a bitcoin could go up or down so if you sell a car for a bitcoin and bitcoin is worth thirty thousand dollars today,0.8374,i know like i

and changes you are making to ensure you are not making our countries a vaccine hesitancy problem wars he faulted the company for insufficient zeal in earlier efforts to control political speech quote in the electoral context you tested and deployed an algorithmic shift that promoted quality news and information about the election you only did this however after an election you helped increase skepticism in at an insurrection which was plotted in large part by our platform and then you turned it back off i want some assurances based in data you are not doing the same thing again here and the executive responded understood again hardly broader narrative that when democrats do not like an outcome it must be that social media is to blame it must be manipulation by outside forces on april 14th we already pressed the executive about quote why the top post about vaccines today is tucker carlson saying they do not work i want to know what reduction actually looks like he said the executive responded running this down now on april 23rd flaherty sent the executive an internal memo he claimed had been circulating in the white house it asserts that facebook plays a major role in the spread of coving vaccine information and accuses the company of among other things failure to monitor events hosting anti - vaccine and covet disinformation and quote directing attention to coveted skeptics anti - vaccine trusted messengers on may 10th the executive sent flaherty a list of steps facebook had taken to increase vaccine acceptance and flirty scoff quote hard to take any of this seriously when you are actively promoting anti - vaccine pages in search and then wrote and then linked to an nbc reporter 's tweet because this is the way that the stupid little game works members of the media spend their days doing the bidding of the democratic party the white house can pressure social media and social media does the bidding of the white house president biden press secretary jensaki surgeon general david murthy later publicly vowed to hold the platforms accountable if they do not heighten censorship on july 16 2021 reporter asked biden about his message to platforms like facebook and he said they are killing people it 's literally all flaherty also strong - armed google in april 2021 accusing youtube of funneling people into vaccine hesitancy flaherty demanded to know what further message measures google would take to remove disfavored content and this was this was the constant push by members of the federal government to use social media in order to crack down on information they do not like that is absolute madness and yet this is the way unfortunately our news and social media were a narrative is crafted that narrative is crafted by members of the democratic party it is then pushed to the media media are effectively the praetorian guard for the democratic party the media then report this narrative widespread and then officials in the government go to private companies and they pressure them to change their policies on informational dissemination based on what the media have reported by laundering in democratic party messaging this is the stupid little game and it 's extraordinarily dangerous because it has real world impact it means that you and i do not see information we should see on everything ranging from elections to vaccines it 's a serious problem and it goes even further than that by the way it 's more on this in just one moment first if the past couple of years have taught us anything it 's that in a crisis

get your free life insurance quotes see how much you can save again that 's policygenius.com shapiro to get started policygenius.com shapiro as it turns out an enormous amount of pressure has been brought to bear on these social media companies by outside forces connected with for example pfizer so alex barrington who is a vax skeptic he 's been a vac skeptic for a long time i disagree with much of what alex berenson has said with regard to the vaccines i do not think that it is well - founded journalistically or or in the data however however alex barrington is reporting and this is correct that on august 27th 2021 dr scott gottlieb a pfizer director with over 550 000 twitter followers so i will tweet he do not like a tweet that might hurt sales of pfizer 's mrna vaccines the tweet correctly explained that natural immunity after covet infection was superior to vax protection and it called on the white house to follow the science and exempt people with natural immunity from upcoming vaccine mandates that tweet do not come from an anti - vaxxer it came from dr brett gerard a physician who briefly followed gottliba 's head of the fda and the tweet actually said that if you do not have natural immunity she had vaccinated it do not matter so gottlieb stepped in and he emailed todd o'boyle a top lobbyist in twitter 's washington office was also twitter 's point of contact with the white house the post had gottlieb was corrosive he said this is the kind of stuff that 's corrosive here he draws a sweeping conclusion off a single retrospective study in israel that has not been peer - reviewed but the tweet will end up going viral in driving news coverage and uh this apparently resulted in twitter acting through jira an internal system twitter used for managing complaints oh boyle florida got leave 's email to the twitter strategic response team that group was responsible for handling concerns from the company 's most important employees and users please see this report from the former fda commissioner labelle wrote failing to mention that gottlieb was a pfizer board member a strategic response analyst quickly found the tweet did not violate the company 's misinformation rules but twitter wound up flagging gerard 's tweet anyway putting a misleading tag on it and preventing almost anyone from seeing it it remains tagged even though several large studies have now confirmed that what gerard said was actually true a week later on september 3rd gottlieb tried to do the same thing complaining to oh boyle about a tweet from justin hart hart is a lockdown and covered vac skeptic with about 100 000 twitter followers he said sticks and stones may break my bones but a viral pathogen with a child mortality rate of approximately zero has cost our children nearly three years of schooling heart had written gottlieb objected to the words but the simple fact of the matter is that that was right now again this is dangerous stuff now scott golly has been a guest on this program again he was the former fda commissioner the fact that he was using that position and that influence behind the scenes in order to quash the opinions of others is insanity and this is the widespread move you find people who are in positions of influence and those people are able to pressure sort of mid - level management at these big social media companies to quash informational dissemination and then you wonder why levels of trust are so unbelievably low that 's particularly true when you have the pfizer ceo now admitting that immune protection from vaccines does not last for long so the babylon b joke today that pfizer is now going to create a bane suit where you are injected with a vaccine every 12 hours until your body is entirely comprised of vaccine that seems about correct at this point here 's the pfizer ceo who 's admitting that the the length of the durability of vax immunity is is pretty low here i think a lot of people are still wondering what 's going to happen with covid and with your vaccine how are you sort of modeling based on what you have seen this winter so far what does that look like going going forward look we are dealing with a very nasty virus two characteristic one it is if you get sick even the or vaccinated the immune protection that you are getting from those two it does not last for long,0.5887,so this trans activist is saying okay if that 's the case if gender is chosen later then should not we put every kid on puberty blockers so they are not forced by their hormones into the uncomfortable position of being at odds with their chosen gender why not make kids genderless widgets from the time that they are small so that their hormones do not force them into the binary decision between being a boy and being a girl that is what this trans activist is saying now that sounds crazy because it is crazy but it is totally the logical conclusion of the position that gender is chosen and that sex is assigned at birth because if you see human beings as genderless widgets and sex as a biological nuisance then this is the logical position this is the logical endpoint now nobody on the left ever talks about the logical endpoint because they do not want to talk about the logical endpoint the moment you start talking about logical endpoints for these positions the entire position completely falls apart but this person happens to be hitting the nail on the head if you believe that children choose their own choose their own adventure then presumably you should put every seven - year - old in america on puberty blockers so they have the freedom to choose whether they are boys or girls this should be the position okay another radical position that i noticed and i think that is worthy of know noah burlesque is a person who writes for nbc news he writes think pieces for nbc news he tweeted out the other day quote parents are tyrants parent is an oppressive class like rich people or white people a lot to unpack right there so note noah burlesky is i believe a white writer for nbc news who apparently is not earning a low salary i do not know if he has kids if he does what could he 's 50 years old guys i assume he like at a certain point your parental issues are going to have to be solved but parents are tyrants parents is an oppressive class like rich people or white people well once you take the position that the government knows better than you do how to raise your own child that the american federation of teachers should decide exactly what your child learns and that whatever is the prevailing leftist ideology of the day ought to be crammed down on parents parents really do not have autonomy to decide what their kids should and should not learn in fact parents should not even have autonomy to decide what public school to send their kids to well the idea there is that you are you are in fact liberating children from their parents this is a sort of marxist trope in the communist manifesto there is this idea that parents are in fact an oppressive class and that you need the state to liberate children from the bondage of their parents now in the real world here 's how we see all of this there is accepted tradition brought down over thousands of years of human history human nature is fundamentally unchanging parents are there to provide the established wisdom to their children over time people can determine that perhaps an established piece of wisdom is false but that requires careful consideration parents are not an oppressive class parents are will liberate you from the shackles of barbarity if you have ever met a child you understand that kids can not be trusted to do anything parents need to be there not only to provide for them but to guide them in the confusing process of growing up but if you are a big believer in the idea that parents are oppressors that children are innately wonderful and not only innocent but good and that is only the shackles of society that make them bad these are the position positions you end up with the state should liberate children from their parents the state should allow children to decide what their gender is now if all this sounds crazy it 's because it is crazy it is crazy but you watch anything that is crazy becomes mainstreamed within five years within five years this all will be part of the mainstream discussion will be when should puberty i mean the puberty blocker conversation about whether kids should be should be having puberty blockers whether or not they are trans that stuff is basically already on the table i mean when we are talking about judges mandating that parents be who do not want their kids to have fury blockers give their kids puberty blockers at the age of 10 because one parent disagrees with the other parent or when a kid declares themselves trans at 12 and a judge decides that if a parent refuses to do that then the kid needs to be taken out of the home this is already happening in some areas of canada for example that is the case that is being made now how does any of that all of that gender ideology all that belief about the evils of parenting and the good of the state all of that is buried deep within the sort of moderate veneer of joe biden 's philosophy he just does not want to get at it or he does not want to think about it because he might come to these sorts of conclusions eventually the hard left will come to those conclusions if they think about it long enough,0.6094,but we know they work and the gun manufacturers have spent two decades aggressively marking assault weapons which make them the most and largest prophet for god 's sake we have to have the courage to stand up to the industry now words uh can not express how sickening that performance was instead of trying to unite the nation in our grief biden chose politics the bodies have not even all been identified yet they were still taking dna swabs from parents so they could match them to the victims and biden was already taking pot shots at his favorite political targets not to mention rambling off the cuff and repeating himself as always we are being led by an incoherent incompetent fool who also happens to be a very very deeply bad man of course the entire democratic party and almost all the corporate media has taken this same cue now the shooter is hispanic attacking a predominantly hispanic school so there 's no useful racial narrative for the vultures to exploit and that means they go right to gun control and that 's been the story since last night because they have decided to make it the story this morning michael moore was on msnbc ranting about repealing the second amendment just like repealing it outright that 's how far they will go in exploiting tragedy but just as they are standing on the bodies of dead children to make their political points they are also stepping over the facts ignoring them completely because the fact of the matter is that none of the recent mass shootings would have been prevented by any of the quote unquote common sense gun control regulations democrats like biden are proposing none of them another fact is that these shootings happen everywhere regardless of the law as much as the left likes to pretend that the gun laws are the same everywhere in the country that 's not the case many states and cities already have strict gun laws other places have more relaxed laws if the law is to blame here then we should observe that all of the shootings are happening in places with relaxed laws but that 's not what we observe in fact the majority of gun violence happens in blue states and blue cities with strict laws texas of course has has more respect for the second amendment than almost any other state in the union yet the shooter in yuvaldi still had to break myriad laws to commit the horrific crime that he committed would a few more laws have made a difference which laws exactly would have made a difference red flag laws well they have those up in up in new york yet a shooter with a history of violence and making threats exactly the kind of guy that red flag laws are supposed to stop still manage to slaughter people at a grocery store they have got gun control and red flag laws in new york and it still happened so what laws then law is supposedly limiting the types of guns available for purchase well even if you can stop people from buying whatever type of gun you ban you can not stop them from modifying the legal guns to make them function more like the banned ones which is precisely what many mass shooters including the one in buffalo do also a shooter with a simple handgun and enough ammo can can inflict horrendous carnage if he 's attacking defenseless people in a gun - free zone the type of gun just does not seem to matter all that much you could take away every gun and that still would not stop the attacks the terrorists in waukesha just used his car instead of a gun the worst school attack in u.s history happened in 1927 45 people died not one gun was fired because the killer used explosives so what laws what law will stop this universal background checks that 's what nba coach steve kerr called for last night in the wake of the shooting listen to this are we going to do something i am tired i am so tired of getting up here and offering condolences to to the devastating families that are out there i am so tired of the excuse i am sorry i am tired of the moments of silence enough there 's 50 senators right now who refuse to vote on hra which is a background check rule that house passed a couple years ago it 's been sitting there for two years and there 's a reason they will not vote on it to hold on to power,0.663
so because i think a lot of people especially in the last year and a half they have realized that they got to take control of their health and their lives you know trapped at home you can not go to the gym you are eating take out food everything 's being delivered et cetera et cetera what 's like some basic dietary stuff that that people should know well you know the the fact is that based on biochemical individuality you know different shapes of the stomach the pancreas the liver different vitamin d excretion rates and different ways that we all process food as unique human beings paired with the fact that we all have unique genetics right like someone from let us say sub - saharan africa is going to do far better based on equatorial location and sun exposure to high carb intake and lots of fruits and um and a lower amount of like saturated fats compared to someone of northern european descent who does really good on like fish steak fermented foods you know high fat milk stuff like that um you know the idea is that it 's not going to be the same for everybody but we live in an era in which the you know the same type of self quantification test that would have cost like tens of thousands of dollars that say like you know the princeton longevity institute or duke or you know any of these places where you know a lot of execs would normally get tested to really really dial in something like diet or nutrition or supplementation those are available to us in the comfort of our own home now for you know for for a fraction of the cost so people can test their blood they can test their genetics they can test their stool for like you know what what the gut is asking for and and by testing your body by looking at your genetics and by paying attention to your own unique biochemical individuality you should be able to tweak your diet to you and what i mean by that is like you know the same ketogenic diet that your neighbor used to lose 20 pounds might be super crappy for you and cause inflammation and weight gain in you because you have a liver and gallbladder that is not processing that high intake of saturated fats very well or you have let us say like an apple e4 e4 gene which would dictate that high intake of fats predisposes you to alzheimer 's or dementia or you have poor enzyme production that dictates that you can not burn fats that well because you do not have enough lipase and so that 's just one example of the fact that there is no one diet that works well for everyone now that being said a couple of things to think about first of all when you look at epidemiological data for a wide wide variety of the world 's populations probably because humans likely originated somewhere in the fertile crescent something along the lines of like a low - carb ish mediterranean diet tends to work really well for a lot of people you know not like an olive garden unlimited breadsticks diet,0.1149,now again knowing such action would be illegal is the question legally speaking here because if donald trump had a lawyer say john eastman who is advising him that there might be a legal theory that he could pursue it 's not illegal to try to pursue that legal theory this sort of stuff happens in our courts literally all the time people pursue novel legal theories in our courts when it comes to our jurisprudence on a regular basis does that make it illegal for them to do so not necessarily according to the committee donald trump sought to corrupt the u.s department of justice by attempting to enlist department officials to make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the presidential election after that effort failed donald trump offered the position of acting attorney general to jeff clark knowing clark intended to disseminate false information aimed at overturning the election now again all of this comes down to donald trump 's state of mind and as i have said over and over again i have said the obvious thing about donald trump donald trump when it comes to intent crimes is a very difficult man to pin down the reason being donald trump does not have intent to do things donald trump act and react in the moment has he ever enacted a long - term plan for anything everything is seat of the pants for donald trump and so if he went to members of the department of justice he said i just want you guys to say there was electoral fraud is that because he actually believes there was electoral fraud that 's the question or is he doing it despite knowing that there was no electoral fraud and just because here 's the thing about trump just because he was told by bill barr that there was no electoral fraud does not mean that he believes bill barr this is the problem in trying to nail down trump on this sort of stuff the committee says without any evidentiary basis and contrary to state and federal law donald trump unlawfully pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their states now again this comes down to his state of mind i keep going back to intent because when it comes to these crimes they all have elements we can all agree or many of us can agree that donald trump did things wrong things that were bad that does not mean criminal activity so when it says change the results of the election in their states according to whose perception according to our perception who 's attempting to change the election outcome in these states but according to donald trump 's perception maybe he was attempting to justify what he saw as the true result of the election in these states and it continues along these lines so the washington post has several takeaways from the committee report so the first is what is actually in the four criminal referrals there are four charges that they have brought forth the first is 18 u.s code 1512c that is obstruction of an official proceeding so that particular code section is dedicated to the idea that donald trump was attempting to obstruct the counting of the vote the well punishes quote whoever corruptly alters destroys mutilates or conceals a record document or other object or otherwise obstructs influence or impedes by any official proceeding this is one of the two offenses the committee included in john eastman 's referral again the the idea here is that donald trump maybe attempted to get people to change their testimony now what evidence is going to come forth showing that he was exerting serious pressure and what kind of pressure is necessary to sustain an obstruction charge that 's the one that 's going to be the most troublesome for trump then you get to the ones that are um that are very difficult to sustain like at all the obstruction charge is going to be the one that if the doj goes after trump is the one most likely to stick the other three are going to be very difficult because obstruction again is a different crime than the actual underlying crime the actual underlying crime suggesting that trump was guilty of insurrection or that trump was guilty of attempting to foment the overthrow of the republic or any of that kind of stuff the the obstruction charge can be as simple as he gets on the phone with brad raffensberger and says i am going to make your life a living hell unless you do x and x happens to be a thing that is not legal right unless you change your testimony if you called up one of the witnesses now we still have no evidence that i am aware of that suggests that trump directly called a witness and told the witness not to testify truthfully it 's very difficult to sustain any of these convictions criminal prosecution is not the easiest game in town which is why the doj is taking its time with this sort of thing and also why a congressional committee staffed by donald trump 's opponents is not exactly the most viable source of a referral for criminal charges charge 2 is conspiracy to defraud the united states it 's a broadly written statute according to the wall street journal prohibiting agreement to obstruct a lawful function of the government by deceitful or dishonest means in march a federal judge said that trump his post - election conduct may have violated this law as well as the obstruction statute described above now again obstruct a lawful function of the government by deceitful or dishonest means that 's very broadly written and what does that boil down to specifically is that an intent crud it seems like an intent crime it seems as though donald trump would have to intend to obstruct the election which means that he would have to have known that what he was doing was wrong which is always a difficult thing for trump then there is charge three conspiracy to make a false statement this prohibits making false statements to the government the committee suggested that by submitting a false slate of presidential electors trump and his allies may have engaged in a conspiracy to violate the statute but again that is suggesting that you can not have an alternative legal theory whereby donald trump thought that these elections had been stolen from him rightly or wrongly and had suggested the possibility of an alternative slate of electors which has in fact happened in american history before so that that statute does not seem to apply in this particular case and finally the big e right this is the one that they are hanging all of their hats on is insurrection this statue makes it a crime to assist or engage in quote any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the united states or the laws now the justice department has not brought an insurrection charge in any of the criminal prosecutions of the people who actually went into the capitol building shouting hang my pens,0.4394,but we but we in in our country we do not want to hear that we we we do not want that to be true so we do not even talk about the black people on slaves in america why why can not we talk about slavery and talk about it all the way through and uh and and talk about it from front to from front to back why do we got to talk about slavery and act like white people the only people that are on slaves in america why why we talk about slavery and act like all white people had slaves when it was a two percent or so of white people own slaves why why do we act like slavery was prevalent in america in general when only two percent of people enslaved states on slaves and the rest of the country did not believe in slavery how did slavery end white people ended slavery not black people white people did there were white people who never supported slavery never supported slavery there were white people who lost their lives to end slavery abolitionists were white people christian people who never believed that slavery was right ever and they fought to free black people and harriet tubman and others were a part of that liberation of black slaves white people did it and this is the thing that bothers me so much is that you have this scenario where black people hated other black people enough to sell them to white people and in this the americas where you have white people at there is a group of white people who never supported slavery there 's a group of white people who believed in slavery in america there has been white people who existed here before and after slavery who never accepted it and we do not give them any props we act like white people had a change of heart there were white people who never accepted slavery ever they did never have a change of heart they never accepted it ever ever can you give them props to say no there were white people who never accepted this and they fought to free black people never accepted slavery the civil war hundreds of thousands of white people died and somewhat in an effort to free black people who do you think sign these these these uh amendments white people,0.1868,the portland police announced on a loudspeaker that anti - fascist protesters would need to move west away from the patriot prayer rally over a loudspeaker police announced they had reports of weapons held by anti - fascism protesters the police never made a similar announcement regarding patriot prayer supporters although officers did confiscate some weapons from the group a lot of people are claiming that patriot prayer was armed like the daily beast said and that the police never confiscated their weapons but in fact they did and there are photos of it people are sharing photos of shields and batons with confederate flags on them so we know the police did make an attempt to confiscate weapons from patriot prayer and many of these people did in fact give up the weapons and shields they did have an tyfa however was a much larger group and they were blocking the street so it 's not surprising the police made a move on them he accurately mentions that the police told the group to move west and says the anti - fascists do not budge seemingly unprovoked police fired flashbang grenades toward the crowd and charged toward protesters with a mix of batons or her bullets pepper spray and more flashbangs - the cheers of patriot prayer supporters there is now video footage circulating in which portland police officers seemed concerned about squad cars parked within the ante for crowd one of the antiva protesters was struck in the head by a police projectile breaking through their helmet some people have said that if he was not wearing a helmet he 'd probably be dead and i think when you see the damage to his skull and you see the damage to the helmet that 's a fair assessment jarred halt correctly says after the initial police charge some counter protesters threw projectiles at riot cops one of which struck an oregonian reporter police proceeded to use anti riot rounds to force anti - fascist protesters through the city further away from patriot prayer supporters police declared a civil disturbance and sent protesters who did not vacate the area would be arrested and here is right wing watch correctly stating someone threw something from the antiva side hitting a reporter the police did warn the protesters and did tell them to disperse and then started firing riot control weapons at them for whatever reason i do not know a lot of people on the left are upset the police took this action and there are now protests because of it and we will get to that but let me look at some more of what jared holt said at separate points in the day anti - fascist protesters reportedly attacked patriot prayers members exiting a transport bus another video shows an anti - fascist protester striking a man with what appears to be a pole sending him to the ground clutching his head other reporters witnessed proud boys unloading bear mace at anti - fascist protesters and we can see this tweet from brendan o'connor proud boys in a truck just sprayed bear mace at anti fell blocking their way leaving a street full of coughing tearing people behind the media has repeatedly played cover for an tyfa but it 's really interesting that when the police warn the protesters to clear the streets that they have seen weapons and they must disperse and they do not do it they are surprised then when the police moved to clear them out but i feel like the problems faced in our cultural civil war are fueled when you have these news reports from sites like the huffington post and daily beast claiming it was the right that was violent that was armed when that 's not really what happened when you can see from my video clips that protesters wore guaranteed safety and had calm conversations with those on the right why is it that people could go to the right - wing side without fear of harm well they probably feared harm but we are guaranteed safety and no fights broke out among them but when people walk to the other side they are sucker - punched they are pepper sprayed now people on the right were in a truck and they were blocked and they pepper sprayed people that i understand you know you do not want people start banging on your car and starting a fight and maybe that 's the best thing you can do i do not know what the solution is but i do know that we have seen numerous videos from people who were on the wrong side getting beaten by an tyfa we saw a journalist get hit over the head with some kind of object who was left bleeding because of an tyfa and there 's a few more instance i want to highlight ford fisher went to berkeley afterwards and he said after i filmed the anti - shah break the marine corps office window and throw a torch into a dumpster one of them called a few over to confront me they basically told me to leave implying attack if i do not i left get the f back cops are not here they will not help you in the night,0.5709,"and so he heads down to the border the exact same time that trump is on the board which is always going to go poorly for him this of course comes at the same exact time that polling is showing him trailing donald trump in a wide variety of battleground states brand new bloomberg news morning consult swing state voter survey published on thursday shows trump is ahead of biden in arizona 4943 in georgia 4943 in michigan 4644 in nevada 4842 in north carolina 50 to 41 in pennsylvania 49 to 43 and in wisconsin 46 to 42 those are devastatingly terrible numbers the closest state there is michigan which of course is as we will discuss why joe biden is now pandering to the kamas fans in dearborn it should be pointed out by the way that when it comes to michigan the exaggerated tale of how joe biden if he appeals to the kamnik will win michigan is not true when people say that 100,000 un people voted uncommitted in the state of michigan that about 13 % of the number of people who voted in the michigan democratic primary when barack obama in 2012 ran about 10 % of people in the democratic primary voted uncommitted and if you go and look at zborn michigan maybe four or 5,000 people total voted uncommitted in deerborn michigan which was supposed to be the place where joe biden was going to just absolutely get shellacked by the arab american population that tends to be disproportionately pramas in reality a lot of people are voting uncommitted against joe biden not because of the hamas war they are voting against joe biden or voting uncommitted because they do not think he 's a very good president in any case the 45th president donald trump according to the new york post beats out biden in a five - way ballot test trump is 43 biden 37 rfk gets 9 % cornell west and green party candidate joe stein get 1 % each and in a head - to - head trump is ahead further a large part of this is because people think that joe biden is not just incompetent they think that he is scile and that is because he is both incompetent as well as scile according to the washington post biden and trump headed to different parts of the border they vis visited separate texas border towns so president biden went to brownsville texas which is a place where the immigration problem has largely been brought under control meanwhile donald trump went to eagle pass which of course is where immigration has not been brought under control joe biden do not go to eagle pass because it look really ugly for him it actually be quite hideous if you went to eagle pass and then in the background you just see illegal immigrants rushing across the boorder shouting joe biden 's name that would probably be a bad look for him so he do not go to eagle pass none of them went to the border in arizona where we went which is where you are actually seeing most of the fentanyl trafficking happening right now all this also comes amidst joe biden 's white house referring to illegal immigrants as newcomers i am not kidding you this is a thing that they did there 's a white house fact sheet that was put forward on the senate bill that includes some language with regards to the border and here 's what the white house says quote the bill includes $ 1.4 billion for cities and states for providing critical services to newcomers and would expedite work permits for people who are in the country and qualify they keep using the word newcomers as opposed to illegal immigrants how warm do you think americans are toward that proposal seriously that these are just newcomers as opposed to people who are illegally entering the country how many people believe it when alejandra mayorcas the secretary of homeland security says that no executive action joe biden can take would fix the border crisis we know for a fact there are significant executive actions that joe biden took as soon as he took office to reverse what donald trump had done on the border itself here 's alejandro meas however protesting that actually actually joe biden can not do enough there 's nothing he can do on the border via executive action despite the fact that donald trump did no executive actions that the president can take to reduce the number the large number of migrants that uh are coming to the us mexico border that we saw in 2023 and continue this year the fact of the matter is that the in only enduring solution is legislation congress needs to act we have a bipartisan piece of legislation that three senators worked on intensely for a number of months i was very privileged to be at the table to provide technical and operational expertise the administration was represented at the table we need congress to act nobody actually believes that they need congress to act again donald trump did not need congress to act so what did joe biden actually do when he got down to the board well first he staggered around a lot and the video of joe biden just looks terrible it looks as though members of border patrol are escorting an alzheimer patient on a walkabout that 's what it looks like he can barely stagger i mean this just looks to i am sorry it looks awful the president of the united states does he is not physically capable of this job i mean look look at this this is it 's honestly it 's sad to watch he 's effectively dragging his feet you are afraid he 's going to slip on the gravel and and fall over he can hardly walk more than a few steps is the sort of commanding image that you want to be demonstrating in america 's southern border which is wide open to the drug cartels and make no mistake joe biden 's policies have fomented the designs of the drug cartels again go check out the first episode of our series divided states of biden over a daily wire and you will see that joe biden has left that southern border wide open and he 's basically basically acting at the behest of the drug cartels at this point the drug cartels are rushing illegal immigrants to certain parts of the border so as to redirect border patrol from other parts of the border and then once those parts of the border are left unoccupied that is when the drug cartels rush across all the guys with the backpacks filled with fenel that 's what 's actually happening at the border and so seeing a staggering daughtering old man barely holding himself upright around the border is not exactly a good look then joe biden tries to blame republicans for not putting together a bipartisan consensus on immigration they is a bipartisan consensus close the border just do it no one 's stopping you dude",0.6702,jeff and you can not accept offers people never made it does not matter the media immediately left to report that kamas had accepted the ceasefire why in order to shift the moral onus on israel not to go into rafa by the way it is in the interest

lied about how many casualties have been suffered in the gaza strip kamas lies about who is suffering those casualties kamas lies about particular details of attacks including originally the alifa hospital and yet the media continue just eat the stuff up they eat it up because again according to the media western powers are bad or at the very least they are morally equivalent to terror groups here 's how the media responded to hamas 's obvious lie for the first time since that last ceasefire deal which lasted only a week collapsed on december 1st last year this is the first time that we have heard from hamas that they are prepared to accept a ceasefire proposal as we are reading here we want to temper this because we have not got an official israeli response there is in about half an hour or so the usual uh military evening press conference i do not know whether the israeli military will have anything to say in that it 's i mean an agreement to a ceas f would come from the government i guess but there is this scheduled event in about half an hour or so but the israelis are not saying anything at the moment in the last few moments uh we have heard that hamas has announced it has accepted an egyptian qari ceasefire proposal uh these are live pictures in rafa people have been out on the streets celebrating that news celebrating that news which is fake it is literally fake news kamas did not accept a proposal that was actually offered by the israelis the entire media swallowed it wholesale by the way one of the people you hear speaking there is from al jazer al jaaz is a qatar backed propaganda network that literally just propagandizes on behalf of kamas they put up chirons that say genocide in gaza israel barred qatar and al jazer from broadcasting in israel because they are just a propaganda network on behalf of the enemy that israel is attempting to fight which of course led the west to then condemn israel for not allowing anti - israel propaganda designed for israel 's destruction into the country in a time of war i do not remember the united states during world war ii welcoming in all sorts of newspapers sponsored by the by the nazi party of germany in the united states it turns out during times of war you do not typically do that in any case the entire media decided to buy into this crap and it was absolutely crap and it was fostered by the united states this is the part that 's so pathetic it was fostered by the united states so barack ravid who again is a stenographer for jake sullivan he will just write whatever the biden administration wants they just get him on the hotline they say here 's what we want you to write and he writes it he is now reporting according to axios quote israeli officials claim the biden administration knew about the latest hostage and ceasefire deal proposal that egypt and qatar negotiated with hamas but do not brief israel before hamas announced it accepted it on monday so in other words what happened egypt qatar and the united states designed a deal that israel had not even been presented with they then presented it to hamas hamas then went ahead and accepted the deal without any israeli acceptance of the deal and all of this according to israeli officials and in all likelihood was designed to box israel into the corner the united states in other words worked with qatar a state sponsor of hamas and a state sponsored by iran and egypt which is des attempting to avoid any conflict in rafa because it might mean they have to accept palestinians into egypt which of course the egyptians would never do only the jews are supposed to deal with the palestinians never any of the surrounding muslim states all of whom literally all refused to take any palestinian refugees they are co - religionists so axio says the episode has created deep disappointment and suspicion among senior israeli officials regarding the us role in the hostage deal talks and could negatively influence the negotiations going forward us official said this is an extremely difficult process with negotiations conducted through inter intermediaries in doha and cairo he added the us believes israel has engaged in the talks in good faith that israel 's late april proposal was the most forward - leaning proposal to date to secure a ceasefire kamas simply needs to release hostages it 's all mapped out apparently hamas announced on monday it accepted a ceasefire proposal given to it by egypt and qatar when israelis read that hamas had responded they were surprised to see it contained many new elements what were the new elements in the deal by the way that israel had never offered but hamas quote unquote accepted a complete milary withdrawal from the gaza strip the substitution of dead bodies for live ones originally israel had negotiated for the release of 33 hostages kamas said what if we just give you 33 corpses seems like that might make a difference in the negotiations,1.1517,but then we have to pretend not to understand this so as not to be perceived as quote unquote sexist he 's not sexist as it turns out actually you know what i am going to do the science right now he will not know why this is not sexist quote it 's from scientific american our brains see men as whole and women as part evolution might underlie the different processing of female versus male bodies both genders do it a glimpse of the magazine rack in any supermarket checkout line will tell you that women are frequently the focus of sexual objectification now new research finds the brain actually processes the images of women differently than those of men contributing to that trend women are more likely to be picked apart by the human brain and seen as part rather than as holes that is correct according to research published online june 29th in the european journal of social psychology men on the other heart are on the other hand are process as a whole rather than some of their parts again none of this is particularly shocking considering that by evolutionary biological standards men are going to be adjudicated based on their strength and their success rate for reproductive possibility and women are generally predicted for reproductive possibility i am talking about the animal kingdom not even among human beings for youth fertility beauty right these are all biologically based the study author sarah gervais a psychologist at university of nebraska said everyday ordinary women are being reduced to their sexual body parts but she says um it 's it 's also that like that 's just what people do the researchers focused on two types of mental processing global and local global processing is how the brain identifies objects as a whole it tends to be used when recognizing people but it 's not just important to know the shape of the nose for example but also how the nose sits in relation to the eyes and the mouth vocal processing focuses more on the individual parts of an object you might recognize a house by its door alone for instance you are less likely to recognize a person 's arm without the benefit of seeing the rest of her body if women are sexually objectified people should process their bodies in a more local way focusing on individual body parts like breasts to test that idea gervais and her colleagues carried out two nearly identical experiments with a total of 227 undergraduate participants each person was shown in non - sexualized photographs each of either a young man or a young woman 48 in total after seeing each original full body image the participants saw two side - by - side photographs one was the original image the other was the original with a slight alteration to the chest or waist because these are sexualized body parts participants had to pick which image they 'd seen before in some cases the second set of photos zoomed in on the chest or waist only asking participants to pick the body part they have previously seen versus the one that had been altered the result the results should a clear schism between the images of men and women when viewing female images participants were better at recognizing individual parts than they were matching whole body photographs to the originals the opposite was true for males people were better at recognizing a dude as a whole than they were his individual parts and it 's both men and women doing this to women so do not blame the men here says gervais why largely because again this is how men look at women this does not mean this does not mean that this is how men end up looking at women in a relationship this is why relationships are supposed to be predicated not on sexual attractiveness that is the original attraction they are then supposed to be predicated on seeing the person as a whole that is what happens over the course of say a marriage this is why commitment matters in relationships because ladies bit of personal advice men at the beginning are going to see you more as a collection of beauty and body parts than they are as a soul and the more they get to know you and the more you hold off on the physical components of the relationship the more they are going to have to get to know the whole you and maybe commit to the whole you when women complain that they are being treated as pieces of meat by men well going on one night stands the answer is that 's terrible that men are doing that to you also of course that 's true of course that 's true the longer you are with a person the more of their soul you see the more of the whole then you see women tend to be better at this with regard to men but as it turns out women actually do this with women also why because women compare themselves to other women simple fact of the of life women dress for other women for example women do not trust for men they dress to impress other women anyway we will go back to this video where apparently it 's very creepy if a person glances at you when you wear spray - painted ass clothes this crazy guy at the gym kept coming over and staring at me,0.3806,why does this matter if as the data shows democrats are returning their ballots sooner then mail ballots cast closer to election day which in many states will also be counted later may not be as democrat as mail ballots overall they could even wind up being right leaning conceivably let me stop right there and break this down simply that means there 's something called the red mirage on november 3rd they say trump will win in a landslide but then ballots will come in for joe biden swinging the election in biden 's favor based on this from nate silver what they are actually saying what he 's showing is that ballots counted on or after election day might actually be right - leaning that means if on election night trump wins he might be able to actually declare victory because the ballots expected to come in are the remaining republican ballots to put it simply what we are seeing right now is democrats firing off all of their ammo at once in a big burst now it does not really matter in my opinion it just matters for the prediction models the number of votes will be the number of votes if 75 million vote biden and 72 vote trump well then biden is going to win the national popular vote we will see how the alert college plays out but this will change the game as it pertains to the red mirage this data now suggests we should not expect a massive influx of democratic votes after election night so election night becomes increasingly more important and we may actually know the results on election night nate says this means there might not be as much of a blue shift in states with late counted mail ballots especially ballots that arrive after election day in states that allow that as people might assume also keep in mind i am sorry also keep in mind i am assuming that that in the world in which this race is close enough for this to matter is probably a world in which trump has made a fairly big comeback to close the race to say biden plus five if there 's late movement toward trump late received mail ballots might not be so blue at all anyway when it comes to vote counting and the timing of when states are called or what the results look like on a given point on november 3rd 4th etc people are actually oversimplifying when they talk about male votes democrat versus imposing or in - person votes republican there are five trenches he says one early arriving mailboats are very democrat late arriving mail votes probably somewhat democrat hard to say early in person votes are democrat er in person election day votes very republican provisional ballots traditionally democrat but hard to say this year in certain states some of these distinctions may collapse if early in - person person votes are counted simultaneously with election day in - person votes but overall there are a lot of moving parts and which tranches are counted at which time will differ from state to state i have to show you that because the next bit of data is going to be a bit crazy i am showing you this target early from target smart my understanding is that target smart is fairly democrat i am not i am not entirely sure who funds them or what their goal is we are going to do this we are going to go to state and we are going to go to michigan one of the most important states in this election now this is what is sending shock waves among progressives and democrats if as nate silver is saying returned ballots are d plus 31 on average,0.3659,so why does trump set so many people on edge to recapitulate he is exceptionally extroverted particularly with regard to the aspect of assertiveness he 's also low in politeness now that combination has some overlap with narcissism not surprising in a figure who has been in the spotlight and strived to be for so many years however he is genuinely compassionate really quite surprisingly so and appears on the basis of his behavior behavior to be relatively or perhaps even markedly conscientious the presence of those aspects and traits mitigates against what could otherwise be the dangers associated with narcissism we might also spend some time in regard to trump 's personality considering his family and the evidence for the donald 's fundamental reliability and perhaps even goodness that its high level of function indicates the trump children are a remarkably scandal free and stable bunch certainly by the standards set by say hunter biden baron seems to genuinely admire his father donald jr has many of the same personality traits of his father for better or worse but he has also remained free of the taint of narcissistic privilege and power jared kushner married into the family but has certainly done it credit not least on the abraham accord front trump 's beautiful and elegant wife melania keeps her own counsel and is admirable in so doing she does not appear to think that she could or should run the country merely because she 's married to the man who does in marked contrast say to hillary clinton this familial honesty and reliability is particularly telling in the case of the trump family given that the almost universally democrat biased legacy media and its propaganda sistic agents would be thrilled to trumpet any possible misstep on behalf of those near the former president to the skies where there is smoke there is fire or so goes the cliche this is sometimes but not always true the converse may be something more reliable where there is absolutely no smoke even though many hawkey observers are not only watching but wishing for it to appear there is perhaps truly no fire zero scandal within the trump family is reminiscent for me of the zero wars of the trump presidency it 's something easy to take for granted given its too easily invisible non - existence as it 's hard to be grateful for a problem you just do not have but it is a relief and another indication that the bombastic donald j has at least properly ruled his own roost this is also no easy matter as we have seen in the appalling family scandals of the biden white house and is another fact mitigating against the claim that president trump is a danger on the temperamental front we should address one other relevant clinical personality issue following our analysis of personality not least through family consider before we do so that there exist two primary influences on behavior personality and the habit it constitutes and the specifics of the situation in question it turns out that knowledge of the former personality is clearly less useful than knowledge of the second situation or context when it comes to the specific and demanding task of predicting someone 's behavior current or future why not least because psychologically healthy persons are flexible adapting themselves to the specific demands of the current environment despite their trait proclivities even extroverts are likely to be quiet at least when they have been well socialized at a funeral in fact there is often something seriously wrong with those who lack such situational flexibility although strength of character with regard to honesty constitutes a marked exception the psychopath pathologies known as personality disorders which constitute a very serious source of suffering and social conflict are in fact precisely what emerge when someone is too rigid to change with the social demands of the moment this all means that it is most useful to gather evidence about how someone has acted in the past in a given situation if the goal is prediction of their behavior when placed in that situation once again and in the future we have that evidence already at hand in the case of trump this means that we do not have to rely on our observations of his personality for predicting his behavior even if they are well - founded compelling or even professional the man has already been president and for four years what did we learn first and foremost the time during trump 's tenure was peace particularly on the international front the importance of that nonpr really an accomplishment can hardly be overstated war in the nuclear age is infinitely dangerous had trump been the dictator in waiting his foes so loudly and fearfully presume him to be would not some evidence of that have made itself manifest say on the battlefield the typical nars particularly the more malignant sadistic maavalan types have absolutely no qualms about sacrificing others to their imperial ambitions indeed they may well regard it as a great honor for others to die in service of their own glorification trump by marked contrast embroiled the us the most powerful military force the world has ever seen in precisely zero wars zero is a very low number furthermore he negotiated the abraham accords the nine miraculous peace agreements that have built around israel a cohort of if not exactly arab allies at least not outright enemies in a just world trump and his previous team of diplomats should have been awarded the nobel peace prize for this accomplishment which was deemed impossible by the experts decade after decade of the state department it is of significant note too that these accords have held even after the events of october 7th 2023 and all the work that has been done mostly by the truly pathological actors of the islamic republic to set the muslim and indeed the broader world yet again against the jews let us reiterate in relation to our analysis we understand his personality arguably and may even have some remaining qualms about it however donald j trump has already been president and his tenure was marked by an absolute lack of cataclysmic occurrences we can therefore reliably rest assured on that front it might also be noted here that his impolite assertiveness and proclivity not to withdra draw in fear or dismay might be a real strength when dealing with dictators particularly in combination with his openness which makes him able to think outside the box and to bring to the negotiating table the advantage of unpredictability furthermore trump 's time as president was also marked by a not inconsiderable domestic economic record with the arguably marked exception of debt accumulation at least de ent economic performance and peace the fact of these twin facts has put many of the various concerns i once had about trump 's personality to rest as has my now more sophisticated appreciation for his particularized and unique combination of traits the events that have surrounded him as of late have done even more in that regard why well the republican candidate has now attracted a truly remarkable surprise in and stellar group of compatriots around him all highly accomplished and formidable figures each with their own marked eccentricities this is also not something that is likely to occur when someone pathologically narcissistic is running the show that group includes elon musk tony stark genius billionaire playboy philanthropist robert f kennedy charismatic eccentric and int intimidating telsey gabard who is in truth everything that camala harris plays that being vrma swami smart self - promoting creative witty articulate young entrepreneurial and fast on his feet as well as jd vance the hillbilly who pulled himself out of the appalachians by his bootstraps and who would insane times be a veritable poster boy for the hypothetically support the poor and working class left i have been joking to myself and some others in my circle that the x - men have now arrived in reality to rescue the republic this is a transformation that is not yet been fully noted even by the trump campaign itself despite its truly and surre revolutionary nature first and foremost among these new supporters and colleagues of the former president is elon musk he truly is and so comically an x - man as is starkly evidenced by the new name of the controversial social media platform he now owns and was once known as twitter he has been struggling to build x the everything platform for decades with that particular moniker in his mind the whole time the x - men like the avengers was a group of misfit mutant who came together to save the normies from the various monsters of the world it is frequently the case that life imitates art and there were perhaps real reasons stirring in the collective unconscious of the west inclining us to look toward the eccentric and supernormal for our salvation fiction meets reality in this strangest of ways in any case trump is now playing charles xavier to a strange group of mutants or if the similar metaphor of the avengers is more attractive conceptually captain america to the gods and superheroes let us assess this group of remarkable people psychologically one by one i am in fact in a better position to do just that with them than i was in the case of trump as i have personally met musk and the other group members several times with the exception of vp candidate vance with whom a podcast is currently being scheduled let us begin our analysis with mr elon musk the tony stark billionaire although importantly without the arms dealing before diving in however one final important fact should be noted pertaining to the former president the donald is evidently willing to share the spotlight with musk and apparently to listen to what the eccentric but stunningly capable and clearly genius level intellect former south african has to say a cynic might opine that the former president is merely capitalizing on the additional attention his delance with musk might bring him i would object however as a clinician on twin grounds first if trump truly were narcissistic musk might be the last person with whom he would deli the latter musk rivals or exceeds him in fame and power and definitely surpasses him in sheer genius that is not a situation that a truly self - centered and power mad dictator in waiting is likely to appreciate second with regard to garnering attention the genuine narcissist is someone unlikely to believe that anyone else is likely to bring anything of value to the table not already in display in consequence of their own boundless and singular specialness on to elon himself first and formost the world 's premier engineer and inventor is a man clearly and demonstrably capable of doing six impossible things at the same time this speaks primarily of his intelligence musk is exceptionally one in a billion high in general cognitive ability and openness a true genius albeit in the technical manner that is an observation not a criticism with regard to personality he 's not particularly extroverted tilting i would say in the opposite direction although not exceptionally so he is moderate in neuroticism carrying a fair burden of depression like pain with him not least because of a truly rough childhood which he alludes to but does not make a show of there is some withdrawal there run rough shaw over by his brilliance and openness and also some volatility evidenced in his behavior on x online somewhat reminiscent of trump himself musk is also a worker and manager hard and dedicated far beyond the norm so exceptionally high in conscientiousness and agreeable enough particularly on the compassionate side to be very pro - human he is however no pushover is not particularly polite and can and does make the difficult judgments of discrimination that allow him to continually operate and maintain multiple extremely large demanding stunningly diverse and truly cutting edge enterprises his staggering intelligence and business acumen means that he brings something near miraculous to the trump x - men team i would vote for trump as president if i could vote and i can not because i am canadian and forgive me for that just because musk has agreed to play a role in any new administration that trump might bring about he has even wittily proposed to head up a new department of governmental efficiency a phrase whose initials do g indicate the willingness in an inside joke manner to do only good every day as well as signifying a beused but knowing dog whose image has become a widespread meme it has been my diligent and hopeful observation that musk is a good man or at least a terrible complicated man trying very hard to be good which is all we could truly hope if we were the least bit realistic about human nature and our own prospects could musk do to the american deep state what he did for twitter could he prove run and cut so the republic could revitalize stranger things have happened in the course of human history javier mili is trying something similarly demanding in argentina and the us ofa has a remarkable capacity to reinvent itself someone like musk playing a key role in the governance of the greatest show on earth is a once- in a - lifetime opportunity that 's an adventure by anyone 's standards i have met with the next member of this group in question mr robert f kennedy five times speaking with and listening to him at some length each time he has the near manic energy and loquaciousness of those with exceptional verbal intelligence and the intensely focused concentration that pushes people who have that proclivity beyond even their own limits in pursuit of a goal he dreadfully well informed of veritable master of historical minui in a manner nonetheless relevant to today 's concerns he is also someone who like trump and musk can and does draw the overall picture accurately and even in a somewhat prophetic manner he is fearless and dedicated having stood up and successfully against even the largest giants of the proto fascist modern state and his single - handedly drawn public attention to what is genuinely a health crisis of gargantuan proportions despite its invisibility on the political stage until the current time he 's also someone once bitten twice shy a seriously wounded apostate again like trump and musk as well as telsey gabard from his own original favored party the democrats when i first spoke with m mr kennedy on my youtube channel i asked him the same question i always asked the many democrat leaders i have spoken with most privately unwilling as they generally are to risk being seen in public with the likes of me the question when do you think the left goes too far his answer to that in interview one at the very beginning of his presidential march i am trying to run a campaign that brings people together rather than a campaign that tries you know that is based upon you know that kind of tribalism of condemning people for ideologies that i do not necessarily agree with i had my doubts about the suitability of that answer in the long run having experienced precisely what happens when the left goes too far in my own private and personal life nonetheless on that occasion i let the question lie i can tell you however that mr kennedy had plenty to say on that topic when we spoke on youtube on our second occasion the ur while democrat contender for president had by that time experienced running hard and headlong into precisely what i had intimated in the form of my initial and purposefully leading question in consequence robert f detailed for at least an hour his utter dismay with the power mad corrupt ideologically possessed shenanigans of the progressive left the very force that could continue its current domination of the public discourse and seen if miz camala harris and the shadowy and unknown forces behind her ascent to power manag to maintain their positions come november what is kennedy like as a personality extroverted like trump although perhaps not as much so trump is hard to equal let lone top in that regard not without his pain and negative emotion like musk not too agreeable although not at all narcissistic despite his markedly forceful assertiveness in opinion and as a speaker this was evidenced not least by my comparative silence particularly during our second youtube discussion i am a very talkative verbally assertive person for better or worse but mr kennedy had this stage for the vast majority of our time together that was as it should be in my opinion given the circumstances but it is still something that does not happen to me very often even when i intend it to does this mean that rfk is inappropriately forward self - aggrandizing self - centered not my experience one anecdote quite tellingly reveals why rfk jr and i encountered one another one evening in a restaurant i happened to be dining in during my last tour i was there with dr phil in a private room in the back of the building mr kennedy happened into the establishment was informed that we were also there and sent someone forward to ask if he could come and say hello the fact that he so politely sought permission since no offense would have been taken had he not was something i noted as was his somewhat near apologetic entrance asking the two of us very graciously to forgive the intrusion an intrusion it was not as we were happy to see him and pleased that he dropped in he could have just taken that for granted and even justly,0.2726,yeah this has gotten out of control man what god raised jesus from the dead if he could if he do not die well would be the mystery they are like what would be the greatness of i am telling you all man the the apostles do not think that jesus was god they did not think he was i just want you all to start with that premise like if the apostles think he was god they never called him god they caught a rabbi they call him the anointed one the christ they never caught of god they do not think he was god so we think trinitarians now think he 's god but the apostles never thought he was god they listened judas betrayed jesus judas betrayed jesus i want you all to realize judas betrayed jesus he do not he do not think he was betraying god he thought he was betraying the messiah he thought he super trained a great man he thought he 's betraying a messenger from god he do not think he was betraying god that 's why he went see think about this woman if judas knew that jesus was god what 's the point of betraying him you can not kill god so judas betrayed jesus meant nothing judas would have got them too he gave the drop on jesus pretty much being an informant because he thought jesus could actually be turned in and he could get money for it they were seeking the reward to kill jesus they wanted to bring him to justice judas do not think he was god judas thought that he was going to be brought to justice judas thought that he was going to get some money he was going to skate off in the night and then it was revealed to him that jesus was way more than just a messenger way more than just just the average jump and according to the bible jews realized that he messed up and he killed himself judas do not think he was betraying god he thought he was betraying god 's son jesus that 's what that 's what he thought into training or what what we would consider the messiah peter never been they do not deny god peter do not say i do not know that man how i never heard him,0.4719,so it goes in the democratic party goes iowa and the new hampshire and then south carolina nevada california and a bunch of other states on super tuesday right now bernie bernie does not win very many delegates biden has 600 delegates available through super tuesday warren it 's at 5:45 that 's a disaster for biden biden 's entire narrative is that he 's the inevitable nominee and the inevitable president if warren emerges from iowa and new hampshire victorious i do not think that his lead simply holds up in a lot of these super tuesday states bernie sanders is rounding out the top tier of candidates with 286 delegates in those races but i do not think that bernie retains all those delegates because remember all the polls are being done now about all of those states but those states are time - delayed because iowa new hampshire south carolina nevada and then on ones that you have california utah colorado oklahoma texas arkansas tennessee alabama north carolina virginia minnesota and maine and vermont and massachusetts which presumably warren will win since she 's a senator from there if elizabeth warren emerges as the serious challenger from iowa and new hampshire and bernie does not win either of those states i think bernie 's toast i think at that point bernie is done and you can take a lot of those delegates those 286 delegates and you can toss them to elizabeth warren according that cbs news you got pull state - by - state and vote preference new hampshire now sees warren just slightly up over biden and sanders and first choice preference there which is a change for her remember she was underperforming in new hampshire as of a couple of weeks ago they say that that 's a three - way contest but that 's not a three - way contest if elizabeth warren wins iowa and she already is running even with biden and sanders in that state then she wins that state to a biden holds a small edge over sanders in first choice preference in iowa sanders has a narrow edge over biden in nevada but where is elizabeth warren in these states,0.6177,but it certainly does seem like a major scandal nonetheless all of this was moved along politically by leaks to the media about mr flynn 's phone call with the russians the u.s eve drops on foreign officials as a routine but names of innocent americans on those calls are supposed to be shielded from review to protect their privacy yet senior obama officials have had to acknowledge that they unmasked mr flynn 's name and others in their last months in power then what a surprise news of mr flynn 's call and its contents pop up in the washington post did someone say institutional norms all of this raises questions about the role the obama justice department and white house played in targeting mr flynn we already know the fbi had opened a counter - elligent counter - intelligence probe into mr flynn and other trump campaign officials it had come up with no evidence of collusion donald trump 's victory increased the chances that this unprecedented spying on a political opponent would be uncovered which would have been politically embarrassing at the very least targeting mr flynn and flogging the discredited steel dossier kept the russia collusion pot boiling and evolved into the two - year mueller investigation that turned up no evidence of collusion this among other things is what u.s attorney john dorm is investigating at the request of attorney general william barr maybe that 's why mr obama is so eager to distort the truth of the flynn prosecution i remind you this is not some conspiracy theory website this is the wall street journals editorial board now this is as mainstream as it comes is obama nervous is something coming his way the only thing i could speculate is that based on this the that obama and his administration launched the investigation into trump made the claims they did thinking he would never win the one thing i see that benefited them knowing there was no russian collusion but they wanted the investigation anyway it stopped donald trump from purging the swamp getting rid of these people and going after those who were trying to sabotage his administration when trump tried making moves to fire any of these intelligence community members people would if if he did they would accuse him of obstruction of justice because he was being investigated but now we know based on the release transcripts these people knew there was no evidence they had never seen any they were simply jamming up donald trump 's administration this is a major and massive scandal now this is where things get really crazy over at the national review andrew mccarthy reports obama officials and fbi collaborated to invent the russian collusion narrative wow now look you can call them bias but that is a bold statement of fact saying the fbi coordinated very closely with the obama white house on the investigation of michael flynn while the obama justice department was asleep at the switch that is among the most revealing takeaways from thursday 's decision by attorney general bill barr to pull the plug on the prosecution of flynn who fleetingly served as president trump 's first national security adviser flynn had been seeking to withdraw his guilty plea this we know but check this out they say that these conversations took place has been known for over three years ever since a still unidentified government official leaked that classified information to the washington post for almost as long it has been known that the fbi became aware of the flynn kislyak discussions very shortly after they happened that 's the russian ambassador what was not known until this week was that then acting attorney general yates was out of the loop she found out about the discussions nearly a week afterwards from president obama of all people this was a white house powwow on january 5th that was the day when the chiefs of key intelligence agencies briefed top obama white house officials on their assessment of russia 's meddling in the campaign after the main briefing the president asked yates and the fbi director james comey to stick around to meet with him along with vice president biden and national security adviser susan rice yates was taken aback when obama explained that he had learned of the information about flynn and his conversation with kislyak she was startled because she later told investigators she had no idea what the president was talking about yates had to figure things out by listening to the exchanges between obama and fbi director comey the later was not only fully up to speed he was even prepared to suggest a potential crime a violation of the morabund logan act that might fit the facts an act that has never been used and according to many sources only exists because we do not have telephones in the past meaning somebody could travel abroad and claim to represent the uh the united states and it would be hard for anyone to verify now that we have telephones does not really matter if someone claims they rep the us you can just call and verify that 's not the case according to the f2 and fbi report which was appended to the justice department 's motion to dismiss the flint case yates later said she was so surprised by the information she was hearing that that she was having a hard time processing it and listening to the conversation at the same time i will bet they are right that yates was in the dark was not the fbi 's fault two days earlier earlier the bureau 's then deputy director andrew mccabe had briefed assistant attorney general mary mccord the head of doj 's national security division about the flynn kislak discussions evidently not appreciating what the fbi regarded as the urgency of the matter mccord did not pass the information along to acting ag before her white house meeting i will read the conclusion this is a very very long story but i wanted to just show you this because they make the definitive statement that the obama white house was coordinated now take a look at this this is the breaking news michael flynn 's original f uh 302 has gone missing,0.3191,it has since been deployed to nullify even mild regulations of the abortion industry third substantive due process is often wielded to disastrous ends for instance in dred scott versus sanford the court invoked a species of substantive due process to announce that congress was powerless to emancipate slaves brought into the federal territories while dred scott was overruled on the battlefields of the civil war and by constitutional amendment after appomattox that overruling was purchased at the price of immeasurable human suffering now today the right the court rightly overrules roe versus wade two of the court 's most notoriously incorrect substantive due process decisions and casey the harm caused by this court 's foreign substantive due process remains immeasurable because the court properly applies our substantive due process precedence to reject the fabrication of a constitutional right to abortion and because this case does not present the opportunity to reject substantive due process entirely i joined the court 's opinion but in future cases we should follow the text of the constitution which sets forth certain substantive rights that can not be taken away and adds beyond that a right to due process when life liberty or property is to be taken away substantive due process conflicts with that textual command and has harmed our country in many ways we should eliminate it from our jurisprudence at the earliest opportunity so justice thomas of course being clear and concise he 's the best justice in modern american history bar none and uh he is absolutely correct that really the court should have gone even further here and just struck down row on the grounds that substantive due process is is just sheer gobbledyg there are a couple of other concurrences that are worth noting here justice kavanaugh writes a concurrence and he uh and he points out that there are a bunch of differing sort of principles on abortion he says when it comes to abortion one interest must prevail over the other at any given point in pregnancy many americans of good faith would prioritize the interests of the pregnant woman many other americans of good faith instead would prioritize the interest in protecting fetal life of course many americans are conflicted the issue before the court is not policy or morality the issue before the court is what the constitution says the constitution does not take sides on the issue of abortion the text of the constitution does not refer to or encompass abortion to be sure this court has held that the constitution protects unenumerated rights that are deeply rooted in the nation 's history and tradition and implicit in the concept of order liberty but a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in american history and tradition as the court today thoroughly explains on the question of abortion the constitution is therefore neither pro - life nor pro - choice the constitution is neutral and leaves the issue for the people and their elected representatives to resolve through the democratic process in the states or congress like numerous other difficult questions of american social and economic policy the constitution does not address and he continues along these lines and he talks about why the constitution is effectively neutral in this particular case and then he talks about starry decisions he says star decisis imposes a high bar before this court may overrule a precedent the court 's history shows star decisis is not absolute and can not be absolute he says i agree with the court that rose should be overruled according row erroneously assigned itself the authority to decide a critically important moral and policy issue the constitution does not grant this court the authority to decide and um he says i have deep and unyielding respect for the justices who wrote the casey plurality opinion i respect the casey plurality 's good faith effort to locate some middle ground or compromise that could resolve this controversy for america but as has become increasingly evident over time casey 's well - intentioned effort did not resolve the abortion debate the national division has not ended although casey is relevant to the star decisis analysis the question of whether to overrule can not be dictated by casey alone he says in some i agree with the court 's application today of the principles of sorry decisis and its conclusion that roe should be overruled he says after today 's decision this is justice kavanaugh 's concurrence the nine members of this court will no longer decide the basic legality of pre - viability abortion for all 330 million americans that issue will be resolved by the people and the representatives in the democratic process in the states or congress the party 's arguments have raised some other related questions i address some of them here first is the question of how this decision will affect other precedents involving such issues as contraception and marriage i emphasize with the court today states overruling roads does not mean overruling these precedents and does not threaten or cast out on these precedents second as i see it some of the other abortion - related legal questions are not especially difficult as a constitutional matter for example may a state borrow residents of that state from traveling to another state to obtain an abortion in my view the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel,0.9877,but when vladimir putin has already consolidated his gains internetsk and lehensk and the crimea area when he 's already done that and when it seems like this war has settled into a stalemate and when an off - ramp is still not being offered and when we hit the winter and people can not turn on their heater and grandma is freezing in the other room do you think that the governments are still going to be able to get away with this or do you think the population is going to rebel and threaten to get rid of those governments already energy policy has brought down multiple governments in the in on the planet in the last several months sri lanka 's government fell because of their garbage environmental policy we have significant political ramifications up in the netherlands where farmers are protesting the environmental policy of the netherlands government this is likely to become worse and worse because the elites once again they made promises they could not fulfill that if you move toward green energy that the net benefits would outweigh the net detriments so far that has not been even remotely the case van der lan said it is a likely scenario that russia will completely shut down its supplies to the bloc as a result she added any disruption would have consequences for all countries irrespective of their energy needs she said it 's important that all member states contribute to the saving the storing and are ready to share gas with eu nations that might need it now again meanwhile in ukraine by the way is any of this working apparently the answer is not really the sanctions have not been a giant win according to the new york times russia is now expanding its territorial aims in ukraine according to its foreign minister russia 's ambitions in ukraine are now stretched beyond the country 's eastern territories the country 's foreign minister said on wednesday a department a departure from the kremlin 's earlier claims it is not waging a war of imperial expansion foreign minister sergey lavrov told ria novosti the russian state news agency that russia 's territorial aims have changed to now include a swath of the south as peace negotiations have failed and the situation on the ground has changed this is an ongoing process said lavrov adding russia 's objective could expand further if western countries deliver more long - range weapons to ukraine he specifically mentioned the hi mars rocket multiple launchers that the united states has delivered to ukraine which have been instrumental in limiting russian advances by hitting faraway targets including munitions depots on wednesday the u.s promised to deliver another four of those launchers russia 's also stepping up attacks in harrison province in the south which is a possible prelude to a large scale counter - offensive which could shift the dynamic of the war i think that the hope of many in the west is that there will be a large - scale military push from ukraine that will eventually force by force putin to the table before winter but if that does not happen and we hit winter russia 's counting on winter as it has historically in the past winter has been russia 's friend and it seems like that is what russia is banking on right now lavrov said on wednesday moscow is now uh eyeing parts of the gerson and sapporo 's provinces of ukraine 's south parts of which are currently occupied by russian forces as well as a number of other territories meanwhile again the wall street journal pointing out that putin 's gas game is to quote toy with europe 's supply and make its leaders squirm while vladimir putin wages the conventional war in ukraine has opened a second front in europe that is now coming to a head a battle over natural gas european countries have been nervously waiting to see if the russian president turns on the gas taps on the continent in the coming days after a 10 - day period when the main pipeline has been shut down for routine maintenance on tuesday putin said russia would fulfill its obligations but warned that flows could be hit if sanctions prevent further maintenance from taking place russia has been delivering natural gas europe at well below full capacity for months european leaders announced the latest move is an effort by putin to use russian state - owned energy giant gazprom to keep customers guessing again why would not he use the tools at his disposal considering that the west has declared full - scale economic warfare on russia why would not he use energy in this game and all of that is only happening because the united states which is still the global the the world 's top oil supplier the united states has been openly talking about ramping down its energy production you got joe biden yesterday literally saying that he wants to ramp down energy production so the new york times which is a push for all of this they are now whining about it they say war and warming up end global energy supplies and amplify suffering first russia upended the world energy market then syrian temperatures drove up to man for energy forcing some of the world 's largest economies to scramble to secure power for their citizens well they would not have had to scramble if they do not follow your preferred climate change policy for the past 20 years but says samini sengupta and melissa eddy deadly heat and russia 's warren ukraine are packing a brutal double punch upending the global energy market forcing some of the world 's largest economies into a desperate scramble to secure electricity for their citizens france on tuesday detailed its plans to renationalize electricity utility to shore up the nation 's energy independence by refreshing its fleet of aging and nuclear plants germany pushed the eu to greenlight cheap loans for new gas projects potentially prolonging its reliance on the fossil fuel for decades longer europe is not alone in feeling the effects of energy turmoil on a hotter planet again it turns out that human beings very good at adaptation and that means adaptation to change foreign circumstances very very bad at long - term cooperation on mitigation and you know what the left keeps saying is that we should abandon adaptation in favor of mitigation proposals what does all of this mean it means that the economy is likely to be in the doldrums for quite a while longer goldman sachs 's ceo yesterday said you know guys inflation is not transitory it ai not going anywhere how do you think the bind administration is handling the economy when you look at numbers like 82 percent of americans feel like economic conditions are poor how how is by administration handling this i i think the biden administration needs to be very focused right now on doing what it can do to take policy action some of which we talked about to help dampen this down they have got to recognize that this is not a short - term thing they live in elections,0.7391,so this is a brand new race i have been saying this since joe biden got out and kla harris became the democratic nominee by widespread acclamation and or a conspiracy among the elites in the democratic party to shove her in there because they basically had no other choice the bottom line is this the race has now reverted back to where it was basically before the debate so before the debate donald trump did have a solid but slim lead over joe biden in a wide variety of states and nationally and now it seems as though the race is reverting back to those fundamentals we already had the outstanding circumstance of joe biden effectively enduring a mental collapse in front of the entire american public and making clear to everyone that he was effectively scile but that is now in the rearview mirror and now we have kamala harris and so looking at the polls what we see according to the real clear politics polling average is that donald trump is currently leading kamla harris by about 1.9 percentage points in the popular vote that includes a new from new york times sienna which is a onepoint race in favor of donald trump again there is a margin of error that is effectively one or two points there rasmus which is usually fairly prot trump has trump up seven cnn has trump up three against k harris 49 to 46 morning consult has harris up one reuter ipsos has harris up two the majority of polls show trump up but not up huge in the battleground states the latest polling data shows donald trump still with a relatively durable lead in the battleground state a new set of emerson polls shows that harris trails donald trump in arizona georgia michigan pennsylvania and that they are tied in wisconsin but those margins are way down for donald trump from where they were say a week ago against joe biden right now he has up five points in arizona he is up only two points in georgia he is up just one point in michigan just two points in pennsylvania and he is tied in wisconsin in other words much too close for comfort this is a very very close election nate silver poll analyst he says our national polling average today would have had trump plus 1.3 against terrce but it 's been fluctuating rapidly she was down more like two to three points post debate pre rnc more like four points immediately post rnc pre- biden announcement says to be more precise our current numbers are trump 44.8 harris 43.5 kennedy 4.9 that compares to trump 45.2 biden 41.2 kennedy 8 some further evidence here she has less of a third party problem than biden what you are starting to see is the democrats are coming home but not in the kind of numbers they would for say barack obama more in the kind of numbers they would have for joe biden if joe biden had been completely mentally gone well this means that kay harris 's campaign has now launched into full swing and that means she has to do two things one avoid her record and two she has to just massage the media the media has to massage her right back it 's basically a really bad between kla harris and the media and the the the love affair between the democratic party and the media is back in full bloom for just a little while there there was a little bit of of tension but now that tension has been resolved in a sweet embrace and that is what we are seeing from the media so kamla harris has now put out her very first ad her first ad you knew it was coming features the music of beyonce more gay pride flags than american flags and a lot of talk about freedom now that 's a weird word coming from kla harris as we will see because it turns out she is not very much in favor of freedom by freedom she basically means abortion and your taxpayer money going to things she wants she does not mean typically what people mean by freedom which is being left alone by the federal government she means something very different but this is a very gauzy ad again with the beyonce music very slickly cut filled with meaningless slogans that presumably make the vapid in the media feel really good about themselves here we go in this election we face the question what kind of country do we want to live in there are some people who think we should be a country of chaos of fear of hate but us we choose something different we choose kamala are you kidding me we choose [ music ] freedom people are laughing they are smiling because in k harris 's america there 's so much laughter and smiling many pride progress flags as well the freedom to be safe from gun violence the freedom to make decisions about your own body we choose a future where no child lives in poverty where we can no one has poverty anymore,0.5097,but you do not want to feel totally unplugged raycon wireless earbuds those are

inflated is that there are a set number of bitcoins in circulation a certain number are being added every year but it 's a very very low number the bitcoins that are in circulation can not be jacked around with they can not be counterfeited and that is because the crypto technology that is used in order to encrypt the transactions right people are using cryptography they are using actual cryptography in order to protect the transactions that take place and you have heard of this thing called blockchain but blockchain technology essentially is every time somebody uses a portion of bitcoin for a transaction they are an entire group of people they are called bitcoin miners and their job is to simply verify the transaction their job is to try and unlock all of the cryptography in order to ensure the transaction is legitimate and to make sure that you can not use the same cryptocurrency twice right this is sometimes what people worry about is that somebody has a bitcoin and they simultaneously give the bitcoin to two different people that can not happen thanks to blockchain technology so once a certain number of transactions are verified that is called a block every time the the bitcoin miners create a block it is added to the blockchain right with every block that is added to the blockchain you are creating a more and more unbreakable chain of events and more faith and credit in the bitcoin itself which is why it 's good,0.8093,christmas is coming early this year for thousands or probably i guess tens of thousands of twitter users who had been banned over the years because elon announced that starting next week he will be issuing amnesty for nearly all banned twitter accounts saying that he 's going to start reinstating every banned twitter account with the exception of accounts that broke the law or if they were specifically just part of a spamming operation you probably heard that last week he reinstated donald trump 's account but he 's not tweeting because he 's exclusively on his own platform through social followed by project veritas and marjorie taylor green 's personal account and a handful of other popular conservative accounts that were wrongfully banned then on wednesday he posted this poll asking should twitter offer a general amnesty to suspended accounts provided they have not broken the law or engaged and egregious spam and then yesterday morning after 24 hours the final results showed that 72 percent said yes and then he replied saying the people have spoken amnesty begins next week as you know the marxist democrats and the liberal media industrial complex were i guess are because they are never going to get over it are extremely upset that elon has reinstated president trump 's account in a handful of others but that pales in comparison to how upset they are about this they are going to continue to melt down about this for months and probably actually for years the washington compost says that he is opening the gates of hell elon musk plans to reinstate nearly all previously banned twitter accounts to the alarm of activists and online trust and safety experts this is the big task that i have been saying he would ultimately have to face which will determine whether or not he is a free speech absolutist and despite him allowing president trump and a handful of others back in the platform he did say that he would not reinstate alex jones account and then double down saying too bad when people kept pushing back triple down and then quadrupled down in a series of comments saying part that because one of his own children died in his arms when they were young he has no sympathy for alex jones for some of the comments that he made about the families who lost kids in connecticut but this might ultimately mean that alex 's account may actually be reinstated and elon can sort of have it both ways by saying that he do not personally intervene to specifically reinstate alex 's account he just implemented a new policy that said if anybody do not break the law or were not a spam bot their account gets reinstated there was already a concerted effort to ban twitter from the apple and google app stores after he reinstated president trump 's account but now that he is going to reinstate virtually everyone there is an enormous push this from cnbc apple and elon musk 's twitter are on a collision course apple executive phil schiller who oversees the app store deleted his twitter account and this was before elon made the big announcement about blanket amnesty former twitter ceo jack dorsey sees the writing on the wall and yesterday said we need a new mobile os operating system that 's web only and then continued with a thread posting to various projects and expanding on the comments for how we need the internet to work on cell phones without having to rely on getting apps from the app store sort of like or exactly like what gab did because gab had been banned from the app stores years ago because gab is a truly free speech platform and they will not bow down to the ridiculous terms of service that are laid out by apple and google in order to allow apps to be downloaded onto your phone and that 's what elon is going to have to do with twitter and he knows it and jack dorsey knows it which is why they are working on that project and not only just to avoid the tyrants of the terms of service of apple and google but also because in order to be in the apple app store probably the google app store as well they demand between 15 and 30 percent of revenue that is generated through in - app purchases and elon is going to go to a subscription only or a largely subscription model and in order to prevent apple and google from siphoning up to 30 percent of the revenue he 's going to just have to bypass them and again this is how gab does it on apple on an iphone or an ipad you opened the safari browser go to gav.com and then click add to home screen or save to home screen and they might be changing the terminology and the icons but that 's how you do it you either click this thing and then that shows up the add to home screen but you can figure it out that 's how you do it and then that 's exactly what twitter is ultimately going to have to do and it functions exactly like an app but you do not get push notifications sent to your device which is actually great but then apple will probably just block the domain on the safari browser because like alex jones says this is an infowar and let me know in the comments whether or not you guys are having this issue on your ipad or on your iphone but on mine if i pull up safari i literally can not go to infowars.com it just does not load i was able to save gab to the home screen like i said but when i want to do it to infowars which on my old ipad i actually had the old app still saved before they banned it and the app surprisingly still functioned but then on my new one it will not allow me to even load infowars.com to then save to the home screen by the way taylor lorenz the woman who wrote this article for the washington compost about elon opening up the gates of hell is the same one who went on msnbc and literally broke down into tears crying because people were sending her mean tweets i had severe ptsd from this,0.182,ok so here 's a bit of good news speaking of the tests the tests are ramping up we are seeing a couple of ways in which the tests are ramping up the white house was was promoting yesterday this this new plan to ramp up testing they they released a white house blueprints that blueprint is sort of vague as to what exactly they hope will be the level of testing that is available as states reopen they suggest that states local tribal governments have to develop testing plans and rapid response programs and maximize the use of all available testing platforms they said today they are working with private groups across the nation to ramp up testing and that is in fact happening you are starting to see major chain stores developing the possibility for points of contact test which is really really good president trump met with the heads of major retailers yesterday pharmacy change testing labs including walmart and cvs health and the white house released what i call the blueprints of its testing plans president trump said and garden press - conference we are deploying the full power and strength of the federal government 's help state cities and help local governments get this horrible plague over with admiral brett you are the administration official overseeing coronavirus testing efforts said the federal government would be able to supply every state with supplies and tests they need to dramatically increase the number of tests really what they mean is they are going to be able to increase the number of tests such that each state will have enough tests for 2 % of the population meanwhile quest diagnostics has announced that they are going to begin selling cova 19 antibody tests now we still do not know whether the antibody actually protects or provides it serious immunity but quest diagnostics is offering a new antibody test for 119 bucks or potentially less if you have insurance quest says this test checks for a type of antibody called immunoglobulin g that is the result of past or recent exposure to cova 19 also known as corona virus the human body produces antibodies as part of the immune response to the virus it usually takes 10 to 18 days to produce enough antibodies to be detected in the blood so the test can help determine if you have been previously exposed it can check whether your body has produced enough antibodies whether or not you were exposed jaye wilmuth who is the senior vice president and chief medical officer for quest says with the introduction of this test and service quest is making it easy for people to access quality testing for antibodies to the virus which caused kovat 19 so all of this is useful all this is good none of it is going to prevent people from going out and working so here 's the good news here 's a here 's an actual piece of good news there 's an oxford group that says that they may in fact be able to produce millions of doses of vaccine they are testing a vaccine right now they may be able to produce millions of doses of vaccine they are hoping by september which would be unbelievable or that would be a triumph of the human spirit and of the human ingenuity if we are able to produce a human a human available vaccine by september we were told 12 to 18 months that would mean that was actually six months which is just insanely fast according to the new york times in the worldwide race for a vaccine to stop coronavirus the laboratory sprinting fastest is at oxford most other teams have had to start with small clinical trials of a few hundred participants to demonstrate safety scientists at the university 's jenner institute had a head start on a vaccine having have improved in previous trials that similar inoculations including one last year against an earlier corona virus were harmless to humans this has enabled them to leap ahead and schedule tests of their new coronavirus vaccine involving more than six thousand by the end of next month hoping to show not only that it is safe but also that it works which would be what again that would be miraculous that 'd be miraculous and by the way if there 's a vaccine and that thing is available i like the end of may what you are talking about would be the fastest recovery in the history of human economics right if a vaccine were available and the vaccine were made available broadly to the american people by the end of the summer people would start investing again the money would come back online all the jobs would come back people would be ready to spend we have all been locked down for over a month some of us for more than that many of us are not going to be likely locked down for several more weeks the oxford scientists now say that with an emergency approval from regulators the first few million doses of their vaccine could be available by september at least several months ahead of any other announced efforts if it proves to be effective and now they have promising news suggesting it might so this is like the best news that we have heard in weeks and weeks and weeks,0.5518,one of the big messages that the democratic party wishes to push these days is that you should transition your child you should you should indoctrinate your kids with gender confusion and then when they are predictably confused you should transition them one of the rationales they use for this is the lie that if you fail to affirm your child 's new gender well then you are causing them to commit suicide there 's a really good piece over at realities last stand dot com which is a sub stack site i believe and um leor saper writes about this he writes about the the actual research with regard to all of the suicidality and discrimination claims by the democrats again their claim is that if you are a man who believes you are a woman and you are suicidal it 's because people will not accept you the evidence to back this is effectively non - existent according to leor sapir writing again at realities last stand.com the firm or suicide monitor has become the central strategy of contemporary transgender activism at times it would seem that activists have little else in their rhetorical arsenal federal courts have used it to impose new policies on schools under title ix when florida passed the parental rights and education act a law that limits classroom discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation to age - appropriate circumstances secretary of transportation pete boudijedge agreed with his husband jason that it would quote unquote kill kids florida 's law was in response to among other things books like gender queer a memoir which contains graphic depictions of oral sex appearing on school library shelves the books non - binary author maya kababy countered her book 's presence in libraries was quote life - saving which again is an amazing claim it is life - saving to have a book in library showing graphic depictions of oral sex according to the left a few weeks later transgender assistant secretary for health and human services rachel levine used the same word to justify the federal government 's support for gender affirming interventions neither levine or president biden who 's given his own impromature to the controversial practice seem to care that europe 's most progressive welfare states have been moving in the opposite direction placing strict limitations on the use of puberty blockers to treat adolescents in distress presumably because of their gender scandinavians are not indifferent to teen suicide rather they have examined the evidence behind the affirm or suicide claim and have found it wanting despite the unwaveringly confident manner in which these claims are often asserted there is no good evidence that failing to affirm minors in their gender identity will increase the likelihood of them committing suicide that claim is based on a small handful of deeply flawed studies that most find loose correlations between quote unquote affirming interventions and improved mental health some find no reduction of suicide a new study claims to find that puberty blockers actually increase the risk of suicide not only is the empirical basis for the affirm or suicide mount for sadia best its dissemination is profoundly irresponsible such extreme rhetoric limits our ability to better understand and respond to mental health problems in vulnerable youth and may itself contribute to the real undocumented phenomenon of suicide contagion if if social contagion is one of the rationales for increased lgbtq plus minus divided by the second command sign option sign control sign identity if if that is one of the rationales the societal contagion we have been ex we have been seeing suicide is catching i mean this is this has been a long time social science finding is that suicidality tends to also predict suicidality inside of groups when you have a few people in a group who commit suicide more people tend to commit suicide inside the larger group part of the problem is the vagueness of the term suicidality says leon sapir he says there 's a difference between thinking about suicide attempting and actually doing it even within the first two categories shades of gray prevail a suicidal attempt for instance can be climbing to a roof of a building without actually stepping onto the ledge it can also mean surviving a self - inflicted gunshots wound to the head women are far more likely to think about and attempt suicide men are much more likely to die by suicide that 's because men tend to use guns by the way actual suicide is obviously more serious than suicidal attempts attempts more than ideation human beings may go through periods of depression in which they contemplate suicide even seriously this does not mean they are a permanent risk for suicide gender activists commonly argue that roughly four in 10 transgender identified youths attempt suicide when not socially and medically affirmed does this research bear out the simple answer is no firstly surveys of tiy suicidality trans - identified youth suicidality rely on self - report do very little to vet respondents when they say they attempted suicide secondly studies purporting to show that transgender identified youth on an elevated risk of suicide tend to compare suicide rates in tiy with rates and non - tiy a deeply misleading comparison this is because ty tiy especially among the new clinical cohort of rapid onset gender dysphoria teenagers exhibit extraordinarily high rates of mental health problems psychological comorbidities quite apart from their gender - related distress and now i would argue that that comorbidity is indicative of an actual linkage but whether you think it is or whether it is not the simple fact is that if you have depression and you also happen to be transgender then saying that if we were just more accepting about the transgenderism that you would not commit suicide obviously that 's not true you still have the depression to the extent proponents of the gender affirming approach recognize these comorbidities right sapir they regard them as the product of social hostility and lack of acceptance though oddly they also claim rapidly rising rates of transgender identification are the result of a society increasingly accepting transgender identity but no evidence supports this hypothesis mounting evidence vitiates it rapid onset gender dysphoria teens are known to have very high rates of anxiety depression history of sexual trauma anorexia and eating disorders all of which typically precede gender - related distress as we have learned from de - transitioners many continue to experience these problems long after they have gone under the knife according to review of the uk 's gender identity development service roughly one out of three girls seeking gender at transition has autism a significant finding considering that being in the wrong body might provide these teenagers with a convenient explanation for social isolation while it is true suicidal behavior is much more likely among trans - identified youth rates of actual suicide are extremely low within the population there 's no basis for believing that affirming them with puberty blockers cross - sex hormones and surgeries reduce these rates even further importantly when researchers compare trans - identified youth with non - trans - identified youth with similar mental health profiles the disparities in suicidal behavior reduced considerably suggesting that it 's not lack of gender affirmation that 's the problem the gold standard for finding finding a causal relationship between quote - unquote affirming medicine and suicide would be the randomized control trial to date no randomized controlled trial has ever been conducted to study the effects of puberty blockers on mental health of gender distressed youth for this reason the fda has never approved the use of lupron or other puberty suppressants for gender dysphoria claims about the reversibility of puberty blockers which are essential to gender forming advocates ethical case for allowing kids to use them rely entirely on referencing the drug 's original purpose which is treating precocious puberty as for their safety the risks of puberty blockers are not fully known but our thoughts include cognitive impairment and bone malformation it 's becoming increasingly clear another major risk is iotrogen is iotrogenesis meaning the use of puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria virtually guarantees the persistence of the condition and continuity and continuation of the patient to more extreme and risky types of interventions right once you get on the puberty blockers you tend to then move on to surgeries and that is significantly more damaging it 's a very long piece and it is worth the read but the bottom line is according to leon sapir who is a fellow at the manhattan institute we should not hold out hope the activists will actually be accurate about any of this because the suicide threat has been their way of achieving their goals but the reality is that these suicide studies do not support their position and taking the therapeutic focus off of gender without completely excluding gender from the picture would actually help but they are not going to do any of this stuff because again it 's a propaganda tool on behalf of the left it is performative it is not about helping kids and by the way if you deliberately confuse hundreds of thousands millions of kids on this stuff you are subjecting them to a much worse life i know we are supposed to pretend that all of this is quote unquote baked into the cake it is not when you have when you facilitate social contagion and that social contagion results in significantly more chaos depression suicidal ideation that is a cost that we should take into account putting aside the fact that gender for affirmation for for people who actually have gender dysphoria has not been proved in any way shape or form to actually alleviate any of the challenges that these people actually face so the house on tuesday passed a bill codifying federal protection for same - sex marriage as according to usa today they did this because one of the chief arguments that the left is making these days is that the supreme court is going to overrule obergefell now the supreme court is not going to overrule obergefell they should a burst fell is a really bad law ted cruz has come under significant fire for pointing out that obergefell is really bad law that the constitution does not provide protections for same - sex marriage that happens to be true ted cruz also said that the supreme court is very likely to overrule obergefell because obergefell has created a so - called reliance interest meaning that there are tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of gay couples who 've gotten married under color of obergefell and to break up those marriages legally speaking would create significant chaos in the legal system he 's right about both of those things both can be simultaneously true is that there 's a major reliance interest that has now been created with regard to obergefell and also that there is nothing whatsoever in the constitution of the united states that guarantees that two dudes should get married that does not exist in the constitution of the united states it is a whole cloth created right by anthony kennedy and the left wing of the supreme court and the fact that this is now considered sort of a core constitutional right is bizarre now in in a normal world what you would have if the supreme court had not ruled this way is differences states estate so california legalized gay marriage massachusetts would have legalized gay marriage new york would have legalized gay marriage and still in places like florida you 'd have presumably civil unions you would have some sort of legal recognition of relations between two men but it would not amount to marriage under law now i thought that civil unions were supposed to provide all the legal benefits of marriage while maintaining that there is a societal distinction between two men getting married and a man or a woman getting married and that was the goal of civil unions but that was not enough the idea was according to the left that this did not provide sufficient respect to gay couples that these were completely morally equivalent now you could be a fan of the idea that people should be able to make whatever legal arrangements they want for example for hospital visitations or for the receipt of of assets under a will if somebody dies or something right all of that you could have done by the way well before civil unions you could just do that by contract but that 's not really what this was about what this was about was the idea that we need government to cram down a particular social standard on the united states and everybody who does not agree that all forms of sexual behavior and sexual relations relationships are morally equivalent all those people need to be essentially punished by government well now the house has taken up the call and they have passed this bill so two things one they could have done this without obergefell,0.6085,but it 's not the same for every country meaning that in the uk before the vast gun ban of the 1990s there were not a lot of guns in circulation in the uk before that and the number of mass shootings in the uk was similarly low before the mass ban so the idea that the legislation in the united nation in the uk sorry in the united kingdom is what created the low level of gun crime is not true there were low levels of gun crime well before that where you tried to apply that same thing in texas say a vast gun ban in texas and you were going to try and grab all the guns in texas i promise you you 'd have an immediate increase in the amount of gun crime particularly against federal officers coming to get the guns the entire purpose in the united states the united states obviously being a revolutionary country against our our mother land uh the the the the united states experiment was built on the idea of the the gun being important in resistance to government tyranny as well as in terms of self - defense now once a huge percentage of the population owns guns once guns are are readily available the idea that you are going to be able to either full scale confiscate or remove those guns in any practicable way is not true that 's certainly the case in the united states and so anytime there 's been a serious gun control regime that 's been put in place in the united states and there are many of them california has pretty ser serious gun control chicago has gun control dc has gun control the rates of gun violence have not gone down because the availability of guns remains widespread typically the rule is that people who follow the law tend to follow the law and criminals tend not to the widespread availability of guns in the united states is not something that can simply be be done away with now as far as sort of the principled argument the principled argument is that i am a law - abiding citizen and i should be able to protect myself that 's that that is the that is the principled argument so in small scale communities for example homeowners associations there are in many cases in the united states gun bans,0.6548
but they do not know much about whales anyways he was swallowed up by whale and then cast back up on shore a number of days later it 's a death and rebirth story and the reason i use it as an image is because it represents something of psychological import that you are all familiar with but that you might not know that you are familiar with symbols are often like that um a symbol often stands for something that you know but that you do not know that you know there 's lots of things that you know know that you do not know that you know almost everything is like that in fact and it 's rather obvious if you think about it because if you were transparent to yourself and you knew everything you knew you would not have to study anything about psychology because you 'd understand yourself completely and we understand ourselves poorly and so we have to study ourselves as individuals and then you know as as as phenomena in the world as as other people and and as mammals and as animals and as living things and as political actors and so on just to get some minor notion of what 's actually going on and what that means in part is that you are more complicated than you can understand and when when you hear say psychoanalytic thinkers talking about ideas like the unconscious the unconscious is actually a representation in some ways of the fact that there 's far more to you than you know about and that what that means also is that there are different kinds of unconscious and we certainly know that to be the case there different kinds of memory for example so a lot of your procedural knowledge is unconscious and so your procedural knowledge is what allows you to do things like ride a bike or walk for that matter because you do not really know how you walk you,0.1139,but i am not just voting for donald trump next week i will be co - hosting a fundraiser for him now this may come as a surprise to some of you i want to tell you why as you know i do not support trump in the primaries i do not endorse candidates in republican primaries but i do tell you who i would have voted for and i told you i would have voted for governor ronda santis of florida if given the choice but ronda stis is not the nominee donald trump is the nominee and he 's facing joe biden who is the worst president of my lifetime because donald trump is the nominee against joe biden i will not just vote for him i will walk over broken glass to vote for him actually i will go into my own pocket to support him which is what i am doing my calculus is really simple america was better off under donald trump than it is under joe biden at home america was safer and more prosperous when donald trump was president we did not have an open border we were not flooding our country with at least 7 million illegal immigrants overwhelming our cities leaving our country wide open to the plague of chinese and mexican drug cartel back fenel poisoning when donald trump was president we do not have a president who tried to use the occupational safety and health administration to force 80 million americans to take a vaccine or lose their jobs and my company do not have to sue to stop it when

soldiers hunted down our allies and reestablished al - qaeda bases when donald trump was president peace was breaking out in the middle east between arab nations and israel and iran was in a box we

now as i have said i will always be honest with you about donald trump he was not my first choice in the primaries he 's a deeply flawed human i have been open in my criticism of i have been open in my criticisms of trump on both character and policy,0.429,from the creation of the printing press to the telegraph to radio and television each new form of media revolutionized society but the development of the internet far surpassed all previous communication technologies especially since it 's now fully mobile and in our pocket wherever we go it 's changed almost everything from how we interact with our friends to how we get our news and entertainment and now most people gage which topics and events are most popular based solely on whether or not they are trending on social media futurist george gilder noted that quote computer networks give every hacker the creative potential of a factory tycoon of the industrial era and the communications power of a tv magnet of the broadcasting era that 's the capability of what 's been dubbed internet 2.0 or the two - way communication networks the internet now enables instead of just static websites comedian dane cook was one of the first comics to use social media to promote himself in the early 2000s through myspace and many of his early critics called him a better marketer than a comic because they do not see his humor as all that funny but could not deny his popularity which was largely because he was an early adopter of the newly emerging social media technology similarly tila tequila became the most popular person on myspace in 2006 from posting racy photos of herself taking advantage of the new medium and getting floods of friend requests from lonely losers online who hope to connect with her in some way her popularity on myspace opened the door for her dating show a shot at love with tila tequila on mtv in 2007 which began her 15 minutes of fame which thankfully ran out soon after in the early years of social media most people just saw the technology as something to use for fun and as a way to entertain themselves or reconnect with old friends but as time went on the true ability to influence large numbers of people through it became apparent amateur video caught hillary clinton collapsing at the 9 11 memorial after her campaign and the mainstream media kept dismissing growing concerns that there was something wrong with her health in the final stretch of the 2016 presidential election the video first went viral through social media before finally getting covered in the mainstream press because so many people were talking about it the washington post which had been calling questions about her health conspiracy theories then finally admitted that hillary clinton 's health just became a real issue in the presidential campaign a bartender working at a fundraiser held by mitt romney in 2012 captured the then presidential candidate on video talking about how 47 percent of the country would not vote for him because they will support obama no matter what since they want free handouts so he was not going to pay much attention to them liberals pretend to be outraged and accuse me of not caring about half the country particularly lower class income folks and the video proved to be quite damaging to his campaign bloggers were the ones who first debunked the fake documents cbs news anchor dan rather claimed with the service records of george w bush from his time in the national guard matt drudge 's drudge report website first broke the monica lewinsky scandal when other outlets like newsweek were sitting on the story and refused to cover it that 's how powerful the internet has become facebook and google now account for 25 of all advertising spending both online and off social media has swallowed up the news business and the power shift has been revolutionary despite the big tech companies being an integral part of most people 's lives unlike almost every other company that offers products or services to the public there are no customer service phone numbers at facebook twitter youtube or google you can not get anyone on the phone to talk with them about the problems you have experienced or the grievances you have with the companies despite names like mark zuckerberg and jack dorsey attached to them they remain faceless corporations you can not get in touch with there 's no local branch you can visit where you can ask to speak with a manager and instead users are relegated to sending tweets or submitting a help ticket from within the app 's dashboard and those attempts to get answers often only result in automated responses thanking you for contacting them and saying they will try to look into it the social media giants are strangely anti - social and over the last four years have been increasingly wielding their editorial powers to control which posts people see and how many people can see certain posts and since the 2016 election we have seen a record number of conservatives completely banned from platforms for having the wrong opinions or posting uncomfortable facts about certain segments of the population the tech giants are even censoring memes that they have deemed offensive and do not want people to see there are several classic books that highlight the dangers of censorship and depict tyrannical governments that use their endless power to snuff out any opposition in hopes of maintaining their control over society george orwell 's 1984 which was first published in 1949 and fahrenheit 451 published in 1953 are two of the most popular examples and were not just written for entertainment they were meant to serve as a warning of what giant bureaucracies could do if their growing power goes unchecked but today in america it 's not the government that 's censoring what newspapers print or what airs on the evening news it 's silicon valley titans it 's mark zuckerberg jack dorsey and susan wojcicki and the marketplace of ideas they are losing and so these industry leaders are silencing influential opponents who speak out against the left 's attempted cultural revolution they are also trying to create a chilling effect by scaring people into not speaking out about certain issues or think twice before sharing certain information on social media out of fear that we will be socially ostracized or even fired from our job so many people are self - censoring themselves in what 's been called the spiral of silence the fewer people who speak out about an issue due to the fear of repercussions causes others who feel that they should say something to be more apprehensive about doing so because nobody else seems to be doing it which in turn causes even more people to stay silent causing the false impression that nobody seems to be opposed to what 's happening thankfully in the united states at least today the first amendment is still intact but in places like canada germany england scotland and other supposedly free countries people are being arrested and charged with hate speech crimes for posting things on their social media accounts that are critical of the islamization of europe from the mass influx of muslim refugees and for voicing their opposition to the lgbt agenda and for other things you are not supposed to think but while americans are still technically free to say these things without getting arrested there are other serious consequences since we are living in an online world where most people rely on a handful of apps to communicate with others back in 1997 harvard law professor larry lessig wrote an article for wired magazine titled tyranny in the infrastructure warning that quote laws affect the pace of technological change but the structures of software can do even more to curtail freedom in the long run he said the shackles built by programmers could well constrain us even more in his book cyber ethics morality and law in cyberspace richard a spinello expanded on this concern saying quote this notion that private code can be a more potent constraining force than public law has significant implications the use of code as a surrogate for law may mean that certain public goods or moral values once protected by law will now be ignored or compromised by those who develop or utilize the code and that 's where we find ourselves today technically private companies can ban people from their platforms as long as it 's not because of their race sex sexual orientation age disability country of origin or other legally protected class but political affiliation is not a protected class and companies could legally ban all republicans or all trump supporters if they wanted to laws and regulations are always many years behind innovation and the framers of the legislation governing our communication infrastructure could have never imagined the emergence of social media let alone how instrumental of a role it would play in our lives the telecommunications act of 1996 was passed by congress and signed into law by president clinton in order to overhaul the rules and the regulations governing communication systems in response to the development of the internet within the act was a sub - section called the communications decency act and section 230 of the law granted immunity to internet service providers domain registrars and website hosting services so if customers use these services in ways that violate copyright laws or criminal statutes the companies themselves are not liable for the legal consequences because they are not deemed publishers but platforms and are not responsible for what their customers are posting in other words if somebody posts an episode of the big bang theory television show on the youtube channel youtube is not responsible for that person violating cbs 's copyright as long as youtube promptly removes the infringing video once notified by cbs if they are notified because youtube provides a service i.e the platform to the public they can not necessarily prevent people from using that service to pro to post copyrighted material so they are given safe harbor and are immune from any civil or criminal penalties when their users break the law section 230 of the cda also granted immunity to internet service providers and interactive websites if third - party users post defamatory information about someone or even if they sell fake merchandise on ebay meaning ebay is not responsible only the person posting the fake listing today many big tech companies are abusing their immunity that 's granted to them by section 230 of the communication decency act by censoring certain posts and deciding themselves what to delete from their platforms when that content is not violating any laws they are now acting as publishers not platforms because they are making editorial decisions about what will and will not be allowed if a person posts something that does not violate any laws then why should the social media companies have the right to take it down if they are in the business of offering a platform for supposedly anyone to use currently there 's a loophole in section 230 that allows for what it calls good samaritan blocking and screening of obscene lewd excessively violent or otherwise objectionable content so these big tech companies interpret objectionable content as being facts or opinions that hurt liberals feelings or undermine the liberal agenda further evidence that section 230 of the cda is outdated and unfair can be seen in the fact that a court ruled that president trump can not block people on twitter after several trolls who he had blocked found a law firm that sued the president on their behalf the court ruled that trump can not block people on social media because it deprives them of access to official presidential statements and his feeds are considered to be a public square this begs the question why is facebook twitter and youtube allowed to deprive citizens access to the same public square if the president of the united states can not deprive someone of access to his statements on social media why should the tech companies be allowed to do that to ordinary citizens facebook and twitter are basically the modern day equivalent of a telephone or a post office they have become an intimate and crucial part of billions of people 's lives it 's how friends and family communicate with each other and share photos and videos it 's how they send out party invitations and look up old friends or family members they have lost touch with it 's how they get their news and it 's how they see what the president is saying imagine the phone company canceling your service because they do not like what you and your friends talked about that 's essentially what facebook and other social media platforms are doing today when they suspend people delete their posts or ban them completely because of what they say when their statements are not crimes but just a controversial divisive or quote hateful point of view the power these megacorporations have over billions of people on the planet to communicate with each other is staggering and the fact that they are working in concert together to enforce their arbitrary terms of service to silence certain people and certain points of view is beyond horrifying for years i have been warning people about this,0.1841,black lives matter activists have pressured police departments across the country to require their officers to wear body cameras thinking they would catch cops on tape acting racist towards black suspects but what the cameras are capturing quite often is an epidemic of certain people lying about supposed racist interactions with white police officers in south carolina local naacp president a pro - black organization was pulled over for not using his turn signal and given a warning despite not having the proper vehicle registration instead of being grateful that he do not get a ticket he published a lengthy facebook post alleging he was racially profiled and fabricated racist statements he claimed the officer made to him the department then released the full unedited body camera footage of the incident which proved that it was not only a routine traffic stop but the officer was actually very friendly the same week a virginia police department released footage of an officer 's body camera after a black woman posted a video on facebook crying about what she said was racial profiling and bullying from a white cop the body camera footage completely debunked her claims a black woman arrested for driving while intoxicated in texas claimed the white officer raped her before taking her to the police station and so once again the department released the unedited almost two hour long footage showing exactly what happened from the moment the woman was pulled over until the time she arrived at the station in the cop car and proved that she was a liar and the officer conducted himself properly a black city council member in mckinney texas was cited for speeding and then arrested for refusing to sign the ticket which is required by law and is not in admission of guilt and so he claimed he was racially profiled and got pulled over for being black with dreadlocks so once again the department released the entire footage of the incident captured on the officer 's body cam which showed that he too was seeing racism where none existed the city council then voted to censure him officially reprimanding him for his behavior and his false statements about his arrest milwaukee bucks basketball player sterling brown made headlines after he was tased and arrested by local police over a parking incident he claimed they overreacted and when body camera footage was released it showed that he was being argumentative with the officers and when ordered to take his hands out of his pockets he refused causing the officers to fear that he was about to pull out a weapon so they subdued him with police body cameras showing so many people to be liars who are fabricating their claims about racist encounters with white police officers liberals are now complaining about the body cameras newsweek magazine actually claimed that they were contributing to black and brown people having their civil rights violated and says that the cameras distort evidence aside from a lot of supposed racist incidents and hate crimes being fabricated by certain people many also hallucinate that there are hate crimes being committed against them a black mayor in a small town in south carolina called the police thinking that she was the victim of a hate crime after she found a yellow sticky substance covering her car which was parked out in the driveway of her home and she assumed that somebody had spray painted it but police investigated and discovered that it was pollen black college students at the university of mississippi freaked out when someone saw a banana peel hanging over a tree branch outside a cabin at a fraternity 's weekend retreat it caught such a concern that the retreat was canceled because some black students were afraid that it was meant as a warning or to harass them but it turns out that a student who had just finished eating the banana hung it on a tree because there were no garbage cans nearby and he do not want to just throw it on the ground where somebody may end up stepping or slipping on it a life - size statue of a gorilla was removed from a child 's circus - themed playground in texas after complaints that it was racially insensitive as you know most playgrounds have monkey bars for kids to climb on and come think of it most white parents call their children little monkeys because they do not sit still many parks and playgrounds also have statues of animals and animal - themed equipment and drinking fountains but after some liberal lunatic got triggered and posted a picture of the gorilla statue on facebook the city received a few phone calls complaining about it sadly instead of telling the people that they are insane the mayor released a statement apologizing for the guerrilla statue and then had the city take it down the city manager mayor and a councilwoman decided to remove the statue monday after concern some could see it as racially insensitive some sane parents who could not believe the city did such a crazy thing brought flowers and balloons and stuffed animals to the playground and made a memorial for the gorilla as a way of protesting the city 's idiotic decision to remove it after an espn announcer referred to venus williams aggressive style during a tennis match as guerilla tactics idiots on the internet thought that he was comparing her to a gorilla and he was fired he then sued for wrongful termination because it should have been obvious that he was referring to her unconventional gameplay as guerilla warfare nike had even produced the commercial once featuring andre agassi titled gorilla tennis espn 's imaginary racism problem is so bad that they once pulled an asian - american announcer from narrating a college football game in virginia because his name is robert lee and the network was concerned that it sounded too similar to confederate army general robert e lee and do not want to get anyone offended of course hate crime hoaxes are more insidious than people imagining racism even though both phenomena are plaguing america the list of hate crime hoaxes from protected groups like gays lesbians and black people could fill an entire book and in fact they do they feel several actually if you just look up hate crime hoax on amazon you will find them that is unless amazon bans them for being white supremacist propaganda there 's a whole chapter on fake hate crimes in my book the true story of fake news by the way which you should order before amazon bans it the victimhood is a virtue mindset of liberals has created an oppression olympics of sorts where people find value in being a member of a group that 's supposedly under attack or marginalized due to their race sexual orientation or gender identity organizations like the southern poverty law center and the anti - defamation league are really just money - making schemes that exaggerate the kinds of threats that they claim to monitor in order to justify their ongoing fundraising efforts the southern poverty law center and the adl routinely label conservatives as racist sexist homophobic bigots anti - government and claim that they are members of hate groups in order to get them de - platformed and canceled radical islamic groups and black supremacist organizations are not included on the southern poverty law center 's hate watch list only anti - muslim ones and right - wing extremists white supremacists,0.5681,"text ben to 98 9898 to get started right now he speaking of joe biden 's corruption long article in the wall street journal by the editorial board talking about how joe biden has assisted hunter 's business quote house investigators keep digging into the biden family business this week comes new evidence of the ways that joe biden helped his son using alias email accounts irs agents shapley and ziggler we talked about provided to the house ways and means committee more information from their multi - year investigation into hunter biden 's taxes and businesses the documents include an 11 - page log showing a list of 327 emails joe sent or received from 2010 to 2019 under pseudonyms including robin wear 456 and robert l peters mr biden was a big user of those shadow accounts apparently the national archives and records administration says that it has up to 82,000 pages of emails and documents sent or received under those alias as while joe was vice president the 3 27 emails listed in the log are exchanges between joe and hunter or eric scharen a former hunter business partner who handled the biden family finances the committee says 54 of those exchanges are between joe biden and eric scharen five emails were exchanged within 5 days of biden 's 24 trip to ukraine another 27 were exchanged prior to his return trip to ukraine in november 2014 those trips coincided with hunter 's lucrative board position at ukrainian energy firm bisma the troops preceded joe biden 's 2015 role in forcing the aler of the ukrainian prosecutor investigating bisma and its ceo nikolai slaveski for corruption another 38 emails originated from within the white house and were sent to joe biden aliases with hunter biden copied the committee does not know the contents of those emails but further evidence provided to congress raises serious questions about hunter 's role at bisma and the political access that he was pedaling and again all of hunter 's former business partners say that was exactly why hunter was involved in these businesses in the first place hunter 's former business partner deon archer previously told congress that quote bisma would have gone out of business if it do not have the biden brand attached to it also way and means has new emails from ziggler that are revealing about what bisma wanted from hunter one is from vadim parari an adviser to burisma to hunter in april 2015 again joe was vp at this time the ukrainian than hunter for quote the opportunity to meet your father and spend some time together in october 2016 email between a blue star employee bluar is one of the companies that was run with hunter biden and one of those emails october 2016 between a blue star employee and eric schwar includes the news the ukrainian government had ended its prob in lavy scharen congratulates the team on its awesome work the blue star employee writes thanks you brought us in so take a victory lap all of which suggest that joe knew full well that hunter was selling the family brand again all of this stuff is going to be swirling around joe and it 's not that donald trump is going to be able to confront joe biden on stage about this there will be no debates i am just telling you right now joe biden is not getting on stage with donald trump one of the reasons he 's not getting on stage with donald trump obviously is his health his senility all the rest of it the other is that donald trump actually would pummel him on the hunter stuff and this time it would have some teeth last time joe just lied about it last time joe said my son never did anything wrong he he never had a relationship with china he never earned a dollar from china it was trump who earned dollars from china all of that has been blown up trump would hit him with the kitchen sink if trump is indeed the nominee as expected so they are not going to be on a stage together but that does not mean these stories are going to go away surrounding joe and the chaos surrounding joe is the biggest threat to his potential 2024 run his entire case right now is that the chaos surrounding trump is so bad that you are better off with the chaos you know rather than the other chaos so it 's a battle of chaoses and so all of the chaos surrounding trump again is his best case that is why all of these trials are going to be damaging to trump thinks joe biden and the democrats think that now the problem for them is that again we have been doing this for a while now if they are really going to hit trump with all these trials they should have announced all these trials you know next year they hit it a little bit early and that means that even while the trials are going on most americans be like we have seen this before now trump for his part he has filed notice on thursday saying he 's going to appeal a dc judge 's ruling that he 's not immune from being charged with federal crimes for his efforts to undue the outcome of the 2020 election the notice is a minor procedural step according to the washington post but it sets in motion one of the most potentially consequential parts of trump 's legal saga as the first former president to be charged with crimes because again this has more to do with the timeline than the actual outcome of the case if the case is delayed beyond 2024 and if trump becomes president the case goes away because trump presumably would just pardon himself or the doj is now run by trump and you would expect that the case basically gets dumped at the altar with that said if the case goes forward trump is going to spend an awful lot of time in court and as trump has pointed out these cases are a stretch the only one of these cases filed against donald trump that has any legal merit at all is the classified documents case in florida and again he 's made the political case that that is in fact a political prosecution given the fact that apparently everybody who 's involved in the federal government has ended up with classified material in their basement now the counter argument to that from the prosecutors is going to be well",0.6652,last night israel finally struck back against iran of course earlier this week over the weekend iran had struck israel with some 350 drones missiles and israel was expecting that it was going to have to fire back against iran in some form or fashion there were a few different options that had been tabled that had been considered one was a fullscale attack on iran 's nuclear facilities for example completely degrading their nuclear program another option would have been to do virtually nothing which is what joe biden wanted to do israel last decided on a third option that would be a targeted strike limited in nature inside iran mainly to show the iranians as a warning okay guys if you decide that you are going to escalate this thing we are going to get to you much more than you are going to get to us and that is what israel pursued last night which is in fact a useful means of deterrence is probably the best available scenario for both america and for america 's allies in the region if israel had gone really heavy there was always the possibility of serious escalation via hezbollah in israel 's north that could have turned into a larger full - blown war now would it have been more in israel 's interest to completely destroy iran 's nuclear facility sure it also would have been a lot riskier right now the united states and israel have been in this very fraught negotiation over what the united states will allow israel to do and so the israeli government took a a sort of conciliatory middle road by issuing this targeted strike against iran and the goal of course was deterrence of iran itself directly saying listen you guys fired 350 drones missiles we knocked nearly all all of that down we basically can hit you anytime anywhere we want so you guys better stand down that was the goal of the israelis and it also offered because it was so limited in nature the iranians in offramp the iranian offramp would be to deny that any of this ever happened which of course is exactly what iran did iran had been maling off a lot about the idea that if israel launched a serious strike into iranian territory then iran would up the anti with a broader retaliatory strike and then you would have an escalating conflict israel issued a strike limited in nature so as to allow the iranian government government the possibility of basically denying that anything had ever happened and that 's basically what happened last night again israel is playing a different game than joe biden is used to israel is playing in an area the middle east where what you do matters a hell of a lot more than what you say joe biden has spent his entire career in places where what you say matters a hell of a lot more than what you do and he is completely unfamiliar with the foreign policy realm where what you do matters an awful awful lot which is why reality keeps clocking joe biden directly in the face forget about israel and iran for a second think about the saudi arabian government when joe biden was a candidate for presidency of the united states joe biden was extraordinarily critical of muhammad bin salman who is the aab parent over in saudi arabia and the deao ruler of the country he was suggesting that he was a mass human rights violator that he had killed kagi jamal kagi who is a pseudo journalist member of the muslim brotherhood who had written for various american outlets and and this meant that the united states had to take a very harsh tactical look at our alliance with saudi arabia up to an including giving the green light to the hoodies in yemen and iranian proxy group by delisting them as a terror group and then it turns out that reality intervened and the houthis as it turns out hate the united states more than they hate the saudis it turns out that the saudis have control over oil supply and joe biden had to go on bended knee to muhammad bin salman and do the thing because what you say in the middle east does not matter nearly as much as what you do and so israel without making a big statement we are going to knock you guys back to the stone age israel simply did the thing and they let iran know that if in fact iran decides to escalate it will do significantly more damage to the islamic republic of iran than it will do to israel all of this again was prefaced by the un security council being a completely useless and garbage institution so of course israel did what it had to do because the un security council could not even bring itself to condemn iran for a fullscale attack on another nation remember it 's an active war definitionally when you fire 350 drones and missiles at another sovereign country the un security council not only did not table a resolution condemning iran for that attack last weekend they allowed iran to then lecture israel suggesting that quote israel must be compelled to stop any further military adventurism against our interests that is what iran told the un security council the absolute unmitigated sheer gall of that is astonishing consider that it 's iranian military adventurism that has led to the entire conflagration in the middle east from iraq to syria to lebanon to the gaza strip to the west bank to yemen that is iranian military adventurism that has led to all that and the un security council because again the united nations is effectively the most eely of international politics a wretched hive of scum and villainy because of that the un security council was never even going to take up the possibility of condemning iran they did however take up the possibility in the last 48 hours of a resolution to unilaterally declare palestinian statehood which would be an incredibly audacious and stupid move considering there is no actual government for a palestinian state the gaza strip is currently governed by hamas a terror group that is in an existential war with the state of israel the palestinian authority has so little control over the west bank that there is open warfare between hamas palestinian islamic jihad and the palestinian authority you may as well simply declare a a state of unicorn land in a random part of the earth that has no government as declar a palestinian state except unicorn land presumably would not necessarily turn into a terrorist state whereas a palestinian state already has turned into a terrorist state and remains as such in any case israel decided that it was going to do what it had do and restore the status quo anti before october 7th and that is really what we are headed toward we will get some more on this in a moment first what 's the first thing you do when you get home after work while you change out of those work clothes you put on your favorite set of loungewear lucky for me i have tommy john to come home to i love my tommy john loungewear it 's soft and comfortable i could fall asleep in it,1.1499,today says the grass always appears to be greener on the other side of the white picket fence feminists say that stay - at - home moms are more likely to be depressed while neo - traditionalist say working moms are not happy the feminists assert that being home along with the kids leads to social isolation an important factor in depression their opponents counter unemployment is stressful how is it not depressing to be at work worrying all the time about your kids the reason i highlighted that story is that it 's damn near impossible to understand why women are becoming unhappy in this story from the guardian gains and women 's rights have not made women happier why is that they take a kind of strange and feminist approach where they actually claim that because men are incarcerated in a higher rate than women maybe this makes women unhappy they say although increased incarceration has affected african - americans more than others even when all americans are considered together the rise in male incarceration between 1970 2000 has been held responsible for a 13 % drop in u.s . marriage rates the reduced pool of free men has also encouraged many women to accept marriage proposals from men they would have otherwise rejected an effect that has been shown to be sufficient to shift the economic advantage of marriage away from women and toward men however this is an insane premise if you were to ask me first of all if we are talking about men becoming happier than women incarcerated more men would probably make them unhappier than women also they say there 's a reduced pool of free men and also encourage many women to accept marriage proposals from men they would have otherwise rejected but i am not sure women would prefer men who would likely go to prison for committing crimes so you could actually argue it 's the inverse with more men going to prison higher - quality men are available but later in the story they say this inside out result probably arises from different cognitive comparisons women in liberal communities are less happy and noticed discrimination because they automatically compare their opportunities and salary to everyone else around them men included traditionally minded women perhaps based on entities more firmly on their gender roles and think only of other women when they evaluate their privilege and opportunities this kind of difference might explain the lessening happiness of american women as women 's rights and opportunities have increased it seems reasonable that women in industrialized countries have internalized ever more complex and optimistic expectations and judged reality against these asked how satisfied she is with her lot in life the housewife of the early nineteen seventies probably just reflected on whether things were going well at home the same question today evokes evaluations across many areas of life declining happiness among women may seem depressing but whoever claimed an expanded consciousness bring satisfaction the issue is that women in the home in the 70s they got what they wanted they won for a woman who wanted to be a mother and marry a good man and support a family they did it congratulations but not a lot of women who want to become ceos who want to reach to the top and they are comparing themselves where they are now to where they need to be and they are less likely to be happy if it is to be assumed that feminism is the cause for the unhappiness that women would be happier in the home than the increasing strides the increasing amount of feminists the increasing wages would probably only make worse but if it 's true that women have now begun comparing themselves to their male colleague counterparts and find themselves to be unhappy than the increase in feminism and the increase in wages is probably going to do good things to bring about more happiness in women but for some reason we are still seeing women become unhappy,0.3722,right you have seen this in very very close races in clark county in nevada there 's a race that 's actually going to be re - run because the margin of error in that race is like 10 votes and so there you can certainly see how voter fraud would change the outcome of the election in michigan where you are talking about 150 000 vote discrepancy even if you are going going to claim that the poll books were out of line it 's hard to see how that amounts to 150 000 votes magically appearing on the other side of the ledger we will get to more of this in just a second and give you status update in these various states president trump has announced that his team will be doing some sort of big press conference today talking about their path forward to victory there are still lawsuits that are outstanding in wisconsin where the trump team is seeking at least a partial recount there is a recount that is going on in georgia uh it is it is pretty clear in georgia that the recount is not going to amount to a trump victory at this point uh there have been extra votes that have been found right there 's some 5 000 extra votes that were found most of them cut in favor of president trump that 's not going to make up the discrepancy in the actual current vote tally as things currently stand so there 's going to have to be extraneous proof that is brought the kraken must be released there needs to be extraneous proof brought now a voter fraud and voter irregularities sufficient to overcome the 12 900 vote gap between joe biden 's count in georgia as currently constituted and donald trump 's vote in georgia as currently constituted also there i have not heard a lot about any lawsuits in arizona uh last time i checked arizona is in joe biden 's column from the votes i have not heard about any legal action in arizona which is a problem for trump because trump needs to win presumably georgia and arizona and either pennsylvania wisconsin or michigan in order to win the election so even if you were able to find the evidence of voter fraud and voter irregularity and georgia is sufficient to set aside the current vote count and even if you were to do that in pennsylvania where the discrepancy is 70 000 votes or in michigan where it 's 150 000 votes you still need arizona in order to do in order to win enough electoral college votes to to shift the election we will get to more of this in just one second because we are now coming down to basically crunch time we are down to the very end of the calendar states are certifying their votes as we speak and the legal process is indeed moving forward in real time so if as i say yesterday sydney pal the president 's lawyer if you are threatening to release the kraken stop threatening and now release it we 'd all like to see the kraken at this point for a lot of threats about the kraken some people think it 's loch ness monster some people think it 's real,0.3641,is that there are literally literally or close enough to literally an infinite number of ways to look at anything and that 's because everything is not only complex and of itself at the microcosmic level almost beyond imagination but that everything is also situated in a context which is actually a determining element of the nature of the thing and the context expanded enough actually takes everything into account and so that makes perception a very weird phenomenon for another reason i i was always amused for example when when i traveled with my family when i was young on our summer vacations we used to do things like get out and look at the border between canada and the united states and that 's a very weird thing to do because you can actually do it and you can step across it and people treat that as if it 's magic in some sense because part of us knows that that border is not there right it 's not a part of the objective world and yet well and yet it is because there you are standing beside it and then if you look at aerial views you can see the farmer 's fields and exactly where the border is and so things like borders between countries have inhabit this weird space between the objective and the subjective that 's a magic space and it actually turns out that almost everything we perceive has that degree of magicality about it i thought also about such things as people 's proclivity to go to museums maybe in nashville for example or memphis to go look at elvis presley 's guitar and you think well what exactly are you looking at when you go look at elvis presley 's guitar because first of all it 's a mass - produced guitar and so why not just look at another guitar and you think well that 's not the same thing it 's like well why is not it the same thing because it 's not and the reason is is that the guitar is not merely something and this is the thing you perceive it 's not merely something made up of the guitar atoms let us say in the guitar molecules it 's also an artifact that was embedded in a context across a period of time and that embeddedness of that artifact is part of what you perceive when you see an artifact like a celebrity something a celebrity owned or the relic of a saint let us say and so and you can say well that 's all an overlay on top of perception and that would be fine except that 's wrong there 's no data so to speak that support that viewpoint that 's not how perception works perception is unbelievably complicated so we see regularities of being and some of those impediments and affordances is the technical term we tend to perceive as objects but we also see the possibilities of being but the problem with that is that the world of objects potentially relevant objects and the world of possibility is vast beyond our comprehension and so then we have another problem that emerges as a consequence of that which is a key and signal problem and the fact that it has been solved precipitously and carelessly hastily is actually the reason for the culture war that 's raging today and that is that we have to prioritize our perceptions we have to prioritize our perceptions to get access to the sense data that hypothetically informs us we have to see the world through a system of value and why would i say a system of value well a system of value is a system of priorities right because to value something is to make it more important than other things that it 's being compared to and why do you need a hierarchy of perceptual priority in order to see and the answer is well you can not say everything at once and so you can only see one thing at a time and which thing and the answer is the thing you think is most important to see at that moment and then the question is well and this is the question why is that the most important thing to see at the moment so imagine this is true in the auditory domain in the tactile domain all sensory domains and the you think that perception is a passive action and that we act upon the consequences of our perception and this is just not true at all there 's no level of the analysis of perception neurophysiologically where you can separate action from perception so for example when you are looking at the world although you do not know this your eyes are moving back and forth very very quickly they have to move if they stop moving for more than a tenth of a second you go blind because you saturate the neurons that are you are using to perceive so intensely with the repetitive stimulation that they just shut down and so at a micro level your eyes are vibrating like mad and then there are cicads above that that are still unconscious that are less rapid and wider and then voluntarily you have voluntary eye fields in the frontal cortex you move your eyes voluntarily to point to what you want to see and you do that because the center part of your vision is exceptionally high resolution each center vision fovial neuron is connected directly to 10 000 neurons at the primary in the primary visual cortex and then each of those ten thousand is connected to another ten thousand it 's very expensive neural physiological real estate and if all of your vision was as intensely high resolution as your phobia which is a very small part of your retina you 'd have to have a brain like an alien because half your brain at any given moment especially for human beings is actually taken up with the problem of resolving the world into conscious vision and that 's all motorically dependent and so in some sense real sense seeing is very much akin to feeling out your you know if you are investigating the structure of something like this column if you close your eyes you can build a visual image of the column blind people by the way many of them can draw just so you know even if they have been blind from birth because they present they they generate visual representations of the world they just do not have light and color,0.2568,that 's fine they started using the word trinity nobody else had ever used it before tertullian i think it was touch aleena one of these guys then there is no doctrinal evidence anywhere of any religion yet believed that god was three different persons that theology it that you believe today start in 500 ad i think it was like for 400 to 500 ad it 's in the catholic encyclopedia that the trinity started in 325 ad and then it came to fruition hundreds of years later the catholic encyclopedia says 325 idea that not seen council they believe that the father and the son were both god the holy spirit was not even a part of it a hundred fifty years later they decided that the holy spirit the son and the father were all god this doctrine is traceable it has an origin it is expressed in the catholic encyclopedia the roman catholic church which is the first major expression of god 's church which i think was not god 's church but many people think it is if you would at least acknowledge that the catholic church was the first to coin it was the first to show pictures of three people and in the encyclopedia says the trinity started the nicean council and some of you all probably even know that because you never read your anything you need you need you need to you need you need to do more research ladies and gentlemen a lot of people are telling me talking points and not telling me scripture and a lot of people are giving me scriptures and then they are leaving out 45 other scriptures that contradict the one scripture that they gave that 's let us do colossians 2 and 9 somebody brought a collage to a94 in christ all the fullness of the deity lives in bodily form that 's not even a bible you you must be getting it from the message from the message so you say for in christ dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily think about this for a minute if the fullness of the godhead was bodily in jesus christ then when jesus died the entire but god had died if people 's bodily in jesus christ the fullness of the deity was indeed then it died on the cross and it was dead for three days yes another you have to be consistent god can not die you guys are they believe in this you you have fallen down a path of hypocrisy god can not die and a part of god can not die and if jesus do not die do not they think about this if the only sacrifice was necessary was the flesh the flesh body of jesus if that was all that was necessary for sacrifice i am assuming mary could have been a sacrifice i am assuming there was other people who were devout jews who could have been a sacrifice if he was just about the body if he was just about the body so let us think about this the fleshly body of jesus died was risen right the body had to be risen i think people forget about this it was not just the soul that was risen jesus 's body was risen that 's like me 9 and on the third day my body 's starting to ride and god raises my whole body out of the grave my whole body to the point where his apostles saw him it was like he 's he 's possibly dead,0.4622,so that 's who voted in new hampshire really do not like bernie now does that mean that he lost of course not this is sort of like the republicans in 2016 deciding that most of them thought trump could not win out that turned out to be wrong right bernie could very well win but suffice it to say the bernie is the candidate in the race with the highest level of name recognition other than joe biden and bernie sanders is the person who has the largest organization and bernie sanders is the candidate with the most money and bernie sanders is the person with the heaviest and most and most loyal base and all he could drag out of new hampshire last night was about 26 % of the vote now contrast that to new hampshire democratic primary circuit 2016 just four years ago in that new hampshire democratic primary bernie sanders walked away with 60 % of the vote 60 against hillary clinton who walked away with 38 % of the vote say skunked her there by 22 % he won an outright majority of the voters in new hampshire in 2016 again 60 percent of the vote well last night he showed up at 26 % of the vote which means that presumably 34 percent of the people who voted for him well 34 percent of that 60 % went to other candidates which means a lot of people in the democratic party are very worried about bernie sanders as the actual nominee in terms of delegate count by the way peabody judge is still ahead of bernie sanders because he came away from iowa with one more delegate than bernie both bernie and budi judge end up winning about nine delegates budda judge shows strong in new hampshire and right now the question is who going to fill the moderate lane because the fact is this if you had to sum up this campaign so far so to understand how to sum up this campaign i am going to have to tell a rather growth story about my throw your old son so the other night about 2 a.m. my son wakes me up from a deep sleep shouting daddy daddy run into his room and he says daddy i need to go to the bathroom,0.6176,the story is about hunter biden 's laptop containing not just illicit photos of him doing drugs and god knows what with prostitutes of undetermined ages but also emails showing him and his father 's corrupt business ties to china are all true so the liber media lied about it and big tech censored it blocking links to the story and suspending the new york post claiming it was all just russian disinformation when in reality the mainstream media was spreading the disinformation trying to cover up the truth but this was not the first time imaginary russians were blamed for spreading fake news remember back to the beginning of the fake news hoax after hillary clinton lost the 2016 election to donald trump at first they blamed teenagers in macedonia for spreading fake news about hillary which democrats say convinced people not to vote for her and then they blamed racist alt - right trope supporters on the internet for spreading hate about hillary then they settled on the grand unifying conspiracy theory that russian bots in collusion with the kremlin were behind all the fake news that was being posted on facebook about hillary in order to supposedly help donald trump win it 's important to point out that the washington post first tried to link russia to internet news outlets whose articles had widely circulated online their supposed evidence for this was a new group of experts called prop or not propaganda or not who nobody had ever heard of before and whose members were anonymous what a surprise do you remember this story the washington post do not even mention what the supposed expert 's credentials were they just claimed that this unknown group were experts who had discovered a russian propaganda campaign was being amplified by a list of websites and youtube channels that they had compiled this story with the headline russian propaganda effort helped spread fake news during election experts say dumped gallons of gasoline on a small little fire which then exploded into the fake news phenomena other news outlets quickly denounced the washington post story and their newfound supposed experts proper not as mccarthyism even rolling stone which had previously hyped up concerns about fake news called their story shameful and disgusting some of the sites proper not listed as publishers of russian propaganda threatened to sue the washington post for defamation if they do not issue a retraction and an apology and after the backlash kept growing they did the new yorker would later write that proper knots report on which sites were supposedly spreading russian propaganda was a mess and their reporter later interviewed a guy named elliot higgins a researcher who had investigated russian fake news stories online for years who told him point blank that quote to prop or not simply exhibiting a pattern of beliefs outside the political mainstream is enough to risk being labeled a russian propagandist the intercept an online outlet run by glenn greenwald at the time who broke the story about edward snowden a few years earlier slammed the proper knot saying that quote the individuals behind this newly created group are publicly branding journalists and news outlets as tools of russian propaganda even calling on the fbi to investigate them for espionage while cowardly hiding their own identities the group promoted by the washington post thus embodies the toxic essence of joseph mccarthy but without the courage to attach individual names to the blacklist with this sudden concern about fake news affecting the 2016 election various studies were conducted which actually proved that fake news did not swing the election or have any measurable effect whatsoever on how people voted new york university and stanford reported that only eight percent of people were actually duped by fake news and of those eight percent who supposedly believed some fake news article was real it 's highly unlikely that those stories actually swayed their opinions about a candidate and instead only reflected what they had already believed columbia journal review conducted a study and found that the fake news audience is real but said it 's also really small and they pointed out that the fake news audience as they called it does not exist in a filter bubble and that visitors to fake news websites visited real news sites just as often as visitors to real news sites visited other real news sites and in fact sometimes the fake news audience visited real news sites more often they even asked if fake news was a fake problem and they concluded their report saying that their findings call into question the scope of this supposed problem at all of course that was before the mainstream media abandoned all ethics and became the biggest producers of fake news the studies into fake news after the 2016 election found that most voters got their news from tv and actual news websites not from some random stories posted on unknown websites and shared on facebook quote our data suggests that social media were not the most important source of election news and even the most widely circulated news stories were seen only by a small fraction of americans the researchers at columbia journal review said even mark zuckerberg admitted that quote to think it influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea he surprisingly confirmed what rational people understood that hillary clinton supporters underestimated the amount of support for donald trump saying quote i do think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could have voted the way that they did is they saw some fake news if you believe that then i do not think that you have internalized the message trump supporters are trying to send in this election even msnbc 's joe scarbrio a rhino republican who hates donald trump admitted this when you look at this fake news and you see what happened up at harvard and you you hear everybody writing articles saying millennials caused hillary clinton the election and you know dogs with three legs cost hillary clinton the election and comet 's passing of the night you just hillary clinton caused hillary clinton the election if you care about democrats digging out of the hole that they have put themselves in now i do you have got to ask yourself what have democrats done to so offend americans that they only have 11 governorships that they have lost control of the senate they have lost control of the house they lost 900 legislative seats over the past six years he concluded it was not fake news it was something much bigger mika brzezinski sighed and said that she do not think people were ready to hear that of course they were not liberals were sinking deeper into a depression unable to handle the reality that donald trump beat hillary clinton on election night and would soon be sworn in as our next president and then every day they continue to lose their grip on reality once the political establishment realized that they could use the ruse of fake news to censor hundreds of millions of ordinary users on social media while at the same time partnering with the silicon valley tech titans to have their algorithms artificially boost mainstream media content to the top search results and in people 's news feeds in the trending topics list the information war went supernova of course as is always the case the mainstream media is guilty of the very thing that they accuse others of doing they are the largest producers and distributors of fake news they are inciting violence they are spewing racism anti - whitism with every breath there 's so much more to this story and the power of this new unholy alliance between big tech and the mainstream media is unlike anything ever in the history of mass media and it 's critically important that everyone understand how and why social media went

wade is now overturned and the issue of abortion returns to the state level where a wide variety of states will now actually attempt a wide variety of legislative solutions on the question of when life ought to be protected in the womb now again prior to roe this was the status of all law in the united states you had different laws in california than you had in alabama but row stopped that conversation with a bunch of justices irrigating to themselves the power to determine what standards should be set nationally on abortion they did it without any pretext in the constitution they do not even bother to try and really make an argument as to why the constitution mandated that the supreme court irrigate that power to itself in planned parenthood versus casey the court backed away from the standard set up in row a little bit but again suggested that the court was going to end national controversy by somehow magically irrigating to itself power that it did not have under the constitution of the united states and finally the supreme court after 50 years did the right thing and reversed roe v wade 6 - 3 now really it was 5'4 with justice roberts 10 it was 5 - 3 - 1 with justice roberts sort of in the middle but joining in the decision to green light the mississippi statute that would have banned abortion at 15 weeks and beyond which by the way is extremely extremely late but here is the bottom line today there 's a lot of talk about how this is going to radically reshift the state of play in the united states politically how this is going to turn into a hot - button political issue all across the united states in federal elections how 2022 will be decided on abortion 2024 will be decided on abortion 2028 will be decided on abortion wrong wrong and wrong and the reason that that is wrong is because when issues become states issues they stop being federal issues and this is indubitably going to be a state issue this happens to be true whether you are pro - life or whether you are pro - choice you are hearing pro - choicers today saying things about how they would like to for example enshrine roe versus wade into into law via congress they do not have the power to do this they do not and they tried to push something a little bit earlier this year they tried to push a measure earlier this year that was called the women 's health protection act it was unconstitutional because it turns out that congress does not actually have the power to regulate criminal activity within states they have to have some sort of connection to federal policy you have seen the congress try to end around this in certain ways like they will say that if it affects interstate commerce then you can not perform this sort of abortion or you can perform this abortion the supreme court is likely to strike those sorts of laws down this also happens to be true for pro - lifers so if pro - lifers say we want a congressional piece of legislation that bars abortion after week six for example in the united states broadly speaking there is a very good shot the supreme court led by conservatives says that there is no constitutional basis to do this because again the congress of the united states is meant to legislate on a federal level state legislatures are meant to legislate on a state level which means that the only federal solution to the abortion issue would theoretically be a constitutional amendment which requires an enormous amount to buy in not only in congress but also in three - fifths of the states so you would have to have an actual constitutional amendment the pro - choicers do not have the power to do that the pro - lifers right now do not have the power to do that which means that practically speaking this is going to break down very quickly into a state 's issue alabama already has its own law new york is going to allow abortion until you actually die of old age it 's going to turn into abortion disneyland over in california and meanwhile in mississippi it 's going to be like you can not get one and that is how policy is done in the united states of america if you think that that is going to motivate votes for democrats that democrats deeply in california and new york they are going to be deeply exercised about the abortion issue in mississippi you got another thing coming and the reason i know this is the case is because in may of 2021 texas passed a law that law effectively ended abortion in the state of texas this has been true for over a year in the state of texas and up until five minutes ago no one thought that this was going to affect the 2022 election it 's not even affecting beta o'rourke in the texas gubernatorial election,0.867,but it 's a little late for that especially when the united states is using russia to make overtures to iran so if you are an erstwhile ally of the united states why would you not hedge your bats why would not you like what would be the pr let us say you are you are saudi arabia and let us say that the united states has had a warm relationship with saudi arabia for a long time because of saudi arabia 's access to oil and now the united states is making overtures to iran would you start triangulating would you start making overtures to maybe russia and china and israel and a wide variety of countries that might have an impact on you rather than staying in the american camp the answer is of course you would because you 'd be a fool not to do otherwise so the entire new world order is reshaping but not in the way that the left one suggested which was going to be a sort of grand global liberal democracy get - together a grand kind of francis fukuyama barbecue that 's not how it 's turning out it turns out that we are seeing again a re - emergence of the spheres of influence that dominated international politics all the way up through basically the end of the second world war that 's not a good thing war was much more common in the spheres of interest area once the spheres of interest area basically broke down into two and it was just the ussr versus the united states the world got a lot more peaceful post world war ii than it was pre - world war ii and as it turns out post - cold war the world got very peaceful in the era of american hegemony the biggest wars in the post cold war era where wars were maybe three four thousand people died i am talking about wars involving major powers that is likely not to be the case in the next few decades because of the global realignment that we are seeing right now and all of that could have been prevented all of that could have been deterred by a muscular america who knew her world who knew her role on the world stage i did right now it 's we are in sort of an odd position with ukraine because on the one hand if you get too hawkish you are actually encouraging vladimir putin to invade more surrounding countries you are encouraging him to use tactical nuclear weapons if he thinks that he 's going to go down on the other hand if you are not more hawkish when it comes to nato if you are not rebuilding the american military if you are not guaranteeing the security of taiwan if you are not guaranteeing the security of middle eastern countries against iran if you are not doing those things what you are likely to see is a world that gets fragmentary chaotic new alliances being formed that we can not completely control and for all those people who think that has no impact on america just get ready for higher prices for literally everything and the possibility of more involvement in war because once war starts it 's difficult to see where it goes most wars most major wars start off as rather contain conflicts and then they spiral out of control according to the new york times that is the worry with putin right now senior white house officials designing the strategy to confront russia have quietly begun debating a new concern that the avalanche of sanctions directed at moscow which have gained speed faster than they imagined is cornering putin and may prompt him to lash out perhaps expanding the conflict beyond ukraine in situation room meetings in recent days the issue has come up repeatedly according to three officials putin 's tendency american official intelligence officials have told the white house in congress is to double down when he feels trapped by his own overage they have described a series of possible reactions ranging from the indiscriminate shelling of ukrainian cities to compensate for the early mistakes made by his invading force to cyber attacks directed at the american financial system to more nuclear threats and perhaps moves to take the war beyond ukraine 's borders and again herein lies the problem i am going to go back to it one more time if the united states had engaged in actual deterrence of russia over the course of the past 20 years but particularly within the last year this would not have happened once you have the invasion of ukraine it is now in vladimir putin 's interest to make it as ugly as humanly possible because that leaves the rest of the world with a couple of choices one is to get an overt conflict with russia which no one wants and the second is to make some sort of concessions to vladimir putin to end this thing so putin is now fully invested in making things hideous and ugly especially because the world has not seen hideous and ugly at least not in the center of europe for a very very very long time like long before any of us listening were probably born you have to be at this point well into your your 80s to remember the last time europe saw significant damage this way the debate over putin 's next moves is linked to an urgent re - examination by intelligence agencies of the russian leader 's mental state and whether his ambitions in appetite for risk have been altered by two years of covet isolation those concerns accelerated according to the new york times after putin 's order on sunday to place the country 's strategic and nuclear weapons on a combat - ready alert to respond to the west quote unquote aggressive comments it was a sign of the death of american concern that defense secretary lloyd austin announced on wednesday he was canceling a previously scheduled minuteman nuclear missile test to avoid escalating direct challenges to moscow or giving putin an excuse to once again invoke the power of the country 's nuclear arsenal john kirby said we do not take this decision lightly but we are trying to demonstrate we are a responsible nuclear power we recognize at this moment of tension that it 's critical that both the united states and russia bear in mind the risk of miscalculation and take steps to reduce those risks beyond canceling the missile test there is no evidence the united states is considering steps to reduce tensions a senior official said there was no interest in backing off of sanctions at this point quite the contrary said the official like other american officials asked for anonymity to discuss the internal debates in fact biden announced expanded sanctions on thursday a few hours after he spoke s p dropped russia 's credit rating to ccc minus the credit rating agency said in a statement that is far below junk bond levels russia was ranked at a few days after the invasion it is too notches above a warning that the country was going to completely default at this point but as we box putin in is he actually boxed in or is he just going to get more and more erratic in just a moment we will get to further unexamined consequences of this war that again could have been fully prevented by a west that actually had the balls to stand up to greta thunderberg on energy and the and the spine to stand up to vladimir putin on territorial invasions over the course of the last several decades but instead decided to neuter itself and now these are the natural consequences we will get to that in just a

governor waltz can criticize donald trump 's tweets but effective smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world donald trump has already done it once before ask yourself at home when when when was the last time i am 40 years old when was the last time that an american president do not have a major conflict breakout the only answer is during the four years that donald trump was president gentlemen we have a lot to get to nora margaret thank you let us turn now to hurricane helen the storm could become one of the deadliest on record more than 160 people are dead and hundreds more are missing scientists say climate change makes these hurricanes larger stronger and more deadly because of the historic rainfall senator vance according to cbs news polling seven in 10 americans and more than 60 % of republicans under the age of 45 favor the us taking steps to try and reduce climate change senator what responsibility would the trump administration have to try and reduce the impact of climate change i will give you two minutes sure so first of all let us let us start with the hurricane because it 's an unbelievable unspeakable human tragedy i just saw today actually a photograph of two grandparents on a roof with a six - year - old child and it was the last photograph ever taken to them because the roof collapsed and those innocent people lost their lives and i i am sure governor waltz joins me in saying our hearts go out to those innocent people our prayers go out to them and we want as robust and aggressive as a federal response as we can get to save as many lives as possible and then of course afterwards to help the people in those communities rebuil i mean these are communities that i love some of them i know very personally in appalachia all across the south east they need their government to do their job and i i commit that when donald trump is president again the government will put the citizens of this country first when they suffer from a disaster now nor you asked about climate change i think this this is a very important issue look a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather and patterns i think it 's important for us first of all to say donald trump and i support clean air clean water we want the environment to be cleaner and safer but one of the things that i have noticed some of our democratic friends talking a lot about is is a concern about carbon emissions this idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change well let us just say that 's true just for the sake of argument so we are not arguing about weird science let us just say that 's true well if you believe that what would you what would you want to do the answer is that you 'd want to reshore as much american manufacturing as possible and you 'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the united states of america because we are the cleanest economy in the entire world what have comm harris 's policies actually led to more energy production in china more manufacturing over sees more doing business in some of the dirtiest parts of the entire world and when i say that i mean the amount of carbon emissions they are doing per unit of economic output so if we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water the best thing to do is to double down and invest in american workers and the american people and unfortunately k harris has done exactly the opposite governor walls you have two minutes to respond well we got close to an agreement cu all those things are happening look first of all it is a horrific tragedy uh uh with this hurricane and and my heart goes out to the folks that are down there uh in contact with the governors i serve as co - chair of the council of governors as we work together on these emergency managements governors know no partisanship they work together to all of the governors and the emergency responders are on the ground those happen on the front end the federal government comes in make sure they are there to that we recover but we are still in that phase where we need to make sure that they are staying there staying focused now look coming back to the climate change issue there 's no doubt this thing roared on the scene faster and stronger than anything we have seen senator vance has said that there 's a climate problem in the past donald trump called it a hoax and then joke that these things would make more beach font property to be able to invest in what we have seen out of the harris uh administration now the biden harris administration is we have seen this investment we have seen massive investments the biggest in global history that we have seen in the inflation reduction act has created jobs all across the country 2000 in jeffersonville ohio taking the ev technology that we invented and making it here 200,000 jobs across the country the largest solar manufacturing plant in north america sets in minnesota but my farmers know climate change is real they have seen 500e droughts 500e floods back to back but what they are doing is adapting and this has allowed them to tell me look i harvest corn i harvest soybean and i harvest wind we are producing more natural gas and more oil at any time than we ever have we are also producing more clean energy so the the the solution for us is to continue to move forward that climate change is real reducing our impact is absolutely critical but this is not a false choice you can do that at the same time you are creating the jobs that we are seeing all across the country that 's exactly what this administration has done we are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future not just the current and that 's what absolutely makes sense and then we start thinking about how do we mitigate these disasters thank you senator i want to give you an opportunity to respond there the governor mentioned that president trump has called climate change a hoax do you agree well look what the president has said is that if the democrats in particular kamla harris and her leadership if they really believe that climate change is serious what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the united states of america and that 's not what they are doing so clearly kamla harris herself does not believe her own rhetoric on this if she did she would actually agree with donald trump 's energy policies now some something governor wal said i think is important to touch upon because when we talk about clean energy i think that 's a slogan that often the democrats will use here and i am talking of course about the democratic leadership and the real issue is that if you are spending hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars of american taxpayer money on solar panels that are made in china number one you are going to make the economy dirtier we should be making more of those solar panels here in the united states of america some of them are 10 but a lot of them are being made overseas in china especially the components that go into those solar panels so if you really want to make the environment cleaner you have got to invest in more energy production we have not built a nuclear facility i think one in the past 40 years natural gas we got to invest more in it kla harris has done the opposite that 's raised energy prices and also meant that we are doing senor time is up governor would you like to respond well look we are we are producing more natural gas than we ever have there 's no moratorium on that we are producing more oil but the folks know and my like i said again these are not liberal folks these are not folks that are green new deal folks these are farmers that have been drought one year massive flooding the next year they understand that it makes sense look our number one export can not be top soil from erosion from these massive storms we saw it in minnesota this summer and thinking about how do we respond to that we are thinking ahead on this and what kla harris has been able to do in minnesota we are starting to weatherproof some of these things the infrastructure law that was passed allows us to think about mitigation in the future how do we make sure that we are protecting by burying our power lines how do we make sure that we are protecting lakefront and things that we are seeing more and more of but to call it a hoax and to take the oil company executives to maral lago say give me money for my campaign and i will let you do whatever you want we can be smarter about that and an all above energy policy is exactly what she 's doing creating those jobs right here",0.5038,so there is an intrinsic value outside of just holding it a lot of people say it 's simply a digital assets digital gold that 's technically true but there is a service function to this now a lot of people use it for nefarious reasons silk road for instance they are buying bitcoin using it to buy drugs and it 's hard to track keep in mind there 's a public ledger so we know what addresses are send receiving where there 's ways to make this harder to track for sure but there 's a reason why people are using bitcoin for drugs and it 's that it 's very easy to make transactions under the nose of the government so that they have no idea what was going on i know a lot of people who have flat - out told me they buy bitcoin so they can hide money from the government they do not wanna pay taxes on it which i personally disagree with do not break the law do not do anything illegal that 's stupid but certainly a lot of people are doing this some of the biggest proponents of bitcoin are the anarcho - capitalist libertarian crowd and they are doing it because they viewed as a way to transact beyond state lines and with whoever they want without having the government track what they are doing or be able to prove that they did anything at all the big question i think everyone wants to want answered should i buy bitcoin will it or will it crash and the truth is i do not think anyone really knows but a lot of the people in the tech community who have been watching bitcoin are bullish on it and a lot of people who are an arrow capitalists or libertarians are also bullish on it it seems to me that most people i know who understand how bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies work are excited by it and want to stay onboard no matter what bitcoin today is around sixteen thousand dollars it 's going to go up it 's going to go down but even if bitcoin falls dramatically it is still valuable in its functionality it is a digital asset that can not be replicated and that 's really interesting using cryptography,0.8026,i mean if this should 1984 baby i do not know what is jones has spawned hundreds of imitators mostly right - wing anti - government conspiracy theorists peddling merchandise and the real story the government does not want you to know about love him or hate him alex is like the canary in the coal mine and these big tech companies conspiring together 2d platformer him the same day changes everything an anti - government right - wing conspiracy theorist they said and how dare i decided sell my own t - shirts in this capitalist country of ours especially when youtube 's do you monetizing most of my videos which you can order for mark dice comm or click the link in the description below and then they brought on this woman to say it 's not censorship because it 's not the government shutting alex jones down it 's private corporations who are just enforcing their own policies i am sorry but these social media services and video sharing platforms are essentially 21st century public squares and shutting someone down because you do not like what they say is the equivalent of a telephone company shutting someone 's phone off because they do not like who they are talking to or what they are saying in fact the federal judge recently ruled that president trump can not block people on twitter no matter how bad they troll him because twitter is considered a public forum after some of his worst trolls got blocked for their incessant trolling and they sued and won a manhattan federal judge said that his personal account with a reply button is a public forum blocking users on the basis of political speech is a violation of their free speech rights the court said cnn even admits that they were the ones who pressured tech companies to ban alex jones and infowars their senior media reporter oliver darcy just tweeted it 's important to note that the tech platforms did not enforce their own rules and take action against alex jones and infowars on their own accord it took media outlets to point out for weeks that infowars was skirting the rules on these tech platforms for them to enforce their own standards and they continue to tattle on alex jones to twitter trying to get him banned from the only platform so far that has not done it this is from cnn.com yesterday cnn on wednesday morning presented twitter with examples of such content available on both the in fours and alex jones accounts a spokesman at the time said the company had no comment beyond the statement that jack dorsey made on tuesday in which he said neither jones or infowar had violated our rules but cnn has taken it upon themselves to decide that alex jones has violated twitter 's rules twitter says that enforce has not violated our rules it looks like that 's not the case meanwhile i have been getting a flood of emails from twitter because people keep reporting my account for hate speech for things like calling lebron james a and saying that alexandria ocasio cortez is a crazy eyed lunatic like alex jones says this is an info war an information war and it 's just starting to heat up if you guys enjoy these videos i hope you will support my channel by getting some of my awesome shirts

scientists had compared the infectiousness of the vaccinated with that of the unvaccinated the media took wallensky 's statement to mean that vaccinated people with breakthrough infections were just as likely to infect others as those who were not vaccinated and now had covet in this way the episode transmitted more reasons for the vaccine hesitance to have doubts internal documents showed that at this point the cdc was scrambling to change its messaging moving from the master narrative simplification that quote vaccines are effective against disease close quote to the idea that vaccines are essential because they protect against death and hospitalization the agency even changed its official definition of what a vaccine does from producing immunity to a specific disease to producing protection from it the fda had originally said that a vaccine less than 50 percent effective defined as reducing the risk of having to see a doctor would not be approved by regulators now something that appeared to the public to be significantly less effective was being not just approved but mandated according to israel 's health ministry the pfizer vaccine data showed that in those who were vaccinated as early as january about five months prior it was only 16 effective a large study in qatar showed that the vaccine was waning at five months in the united states a mayo clinic found the pfizer vaccine to drop to 42 effectiveness while the cdc found it dropped to 66 percent in just under four months of use u.s statistics showed that the vaccinated were still overall far less likely to get infected than the unvaccinated or to get serious illness but israel had been vaccinated earlier than the united states so what lay ahead for america it is noteworthy that this was the moment that u.s government officials and the media chose to assume soon on a daily basis that the country was now in a quote pandemic of the unvaccinated close quote even though it was now clear that the vaccinated could get infected and transmit the virus every day famous americans including entertainers athletes and politicians who had been doubly vaccinated were having breakthrough infections the message that this is only an epidemic of the unvaccinated is falling flat close quote noted harvard epidemiologist michael minna by this point the hesitant were no longer the only ones who had doubts there were many anecdotal reports of great worry about breakthrough cases among the vaccinated including among those who put much faith in vaccines because their immune systems were compromised by age or illness headlines about waning vaccines expressed despair that this pandemic might never end instead of addressing how this disappointment might affect people u.s public health talking heads and twitter certified human nature experts turn now to behavioral psychology a very american form of psychology to deal with the crisis treating their fellow citizens like children or lab rats to be given rewards when good and punishments went bad some seemed to relish telling people that they do not just do what the experts told them to do they 'd lose their jobs their place in school or some other basic need like mobility other more data - driven thinkers including pro - vaccine physicians like eric topol head of scripps research and a man who regards the production of the mrna vaccine as quote one of science and medical research 's greatest achievements close quote now seem quite concerned about the israeli data topple assembled many articles showing how vaccinated populations still fare much better relative to unvaccinated populations in the united states but he also pointed out that breakthrough infections can not just be written off as simply caused by the new delta variant escaping vaccine protection israeli data showed that the potency of the vaccines was fading after five months contrary to what pfizer claimed thus the data showed that the earlier one was vaccinated the less protection one had against delta that finding was crucial because it meant that the new wave in israel was not simply caused because of a new variant that came along the vaccines were losing potency over time fauci and surgeon general vivek murthy stuck to their guns continuing to emphasize to the public that the vast majority of all cova deaths 99.2 percent according to fouchy and 99.5 according to murthy were among the unvaccinated a narrative that was picked up by news outlets which started reporting obsessively about states with high and vaccinated rates and filling the news cycle with one story after another about stupid retrograde americans succumbing to covet their final wish not being for those they loved but for their medical practitioner to broadcast to the world their vaccine regret,0.5493,but it 's not just high school and college kids who are getting confused about whether they are a man or a woman there is increasing pressure on parents and teachers to stop referring to children as boys or girls altogether and instead raise them as gender neutral with no gender at all the very term gender should not even be used for anything but marxists decided to start using it in place of sex in order to purposely obfuscate and confuse people and now they are arguing that we should reconsider assigning as they say babies boys or girls at birth and raise them all gender neutral because they might be transgender or they might not want a gender at all they are trying to convince people that there 's no correlation between a child 's obvious physical characteristics or even their chromosomes and what sex they are and the children should be raised as neither until they grow up and decide if they want to be a boy or a girl or one of the other 57 supposed different genders the marxists have created at the beginning of the 2000 2016 school year over five years ago now teachers in charlotte north carolina were told to stop addressing their students as either boys or girls and instead refer to them as students or scholars because some of them might be transgender or gender non - conforming and might not be comfortable being treated as a boy or a girl the following year in 2017 planned parenthood best known for being the largest killer of babies in the history of the human race published their recommendations for parents on how they should teach their preschoolers about gender wanting parents to teach their kids that genitals do not make them a boy or a girl and that they can be whatever they want yes instead of teaching kids their abcs planned parenthood wants them to learn about the lgbtqs many celebrities have jumped on the gender - bending bandwagon since they are always on the forefront of moral decay the largest gay lobbyist organization in the united states calling themselves the human rights campaign whose symbol is the yellow equal sign over a blue background on you have probably seen it on bumper stickers published a back to school guide encouraging school administrators to avoid using gender to divide and address students and says instead of addressing the class using boys and girls they should use words like friends students or scholars a graduate student in canada was investigated by school authorities after she played a clip of the now retired university of toronto professor jordan peterson discussing his stance on gender pronouns peterson famously refused to use pronouns other than he or she and do not care which of the 57 other different gender identities a student wanted to be called he would only call them by the one that corresponds with their biological sex but refusing to bow down to the requests of the gender benders is now considered to be hateful and dehumanizing and we will get you banned from social media platforms if you call somebody by the wrong pronoun seriously that 's the violation of the terms of service it 's called misgendering them numerous leftist organizations are encouraging nursery schools and elementary schools to quote queer up the education system by reading the children books that encourage them to question or experiment with their gender one of the books is titled introducing teddy which is about a teddy bear named thomas who decides he 's a girl instead of a boy other books include jacob 's new dress and sparkle boy which encourage boys to wear dresses sadly few child psychologists or republican members of congress or conservative pundits in the media have denounced this kind of indoctrination in schools until very recently which is obviously designed to confuse kids into thinking that maybe they should try being a girl instead of a boy and if they wanted to do that that would be no different than styling their hair different young children as you know believe that a fat man in a red suit magically climbs down their chimney in their house with a sack of toys over christmas and then flies away on a slave pulled by magic magic reindeer at a young age they could be taught to believe anything and the reason that normal parents shield their children from certain ideas and images when they are young is because they are too little to understand them and if exposed to such things too soon they will end up engaging in inappropriate unhealthy and dangerous behavior because they will not understand the

check them out,0.5841,but he noted an assault rifle is an automatic weapon there was not an assault rifle used in the florida shooting rather cruz was armed with an ar-15 popping over to the march for our lives website we can see that yes in fact he is correct in their mission statement they say we can not allow one more teacher to make a choice to jump in front of a firing assault rifle and many of you may not be aware but in order for a weapon to be an assault rifle it must be capable of selective fire that means it must have the capability to be adjusted to fire in semi - automatic burst mode and or fully automatic firing mode which an ar-15 does not the point i am trying to make not that i am for or against gun control or anything like that but just that a point is being brought up that the media seems to be pushing heavy gun control narratives acting like these students are for the most part for gun control when there are people who are not for gun control the media debate is certainly less nuanced than the actual opinions of those who survived the florida shooting and not only that but at least in one instance the student is correct the activists are incorrect they have made it up they have made a mis statement maybe they meant assault weapon but assault rifle is wrong sure enough brandon mine off is not the only one bringing this up according to real clear politics florida shooting survivor arianna klein networks do not want us to give our real opinions want us to further their agendas arianna client is a survivor of the shooting and her father who admitted to being a republican at a gun owner said he was approached by a cnn producer on thursday the day after the school shooting and felt they were looking for people who were willing to espouse a certain narrative the producer insinuated to me they were looking for people who were willing to espouse a certain narrative which was taking a tragedy and turning it into a policy debate and i read that as being a gun control debate unfortunately i think a lot of people talking about gun control do not understand what they are talking about i think he 's taking some liberties when he assumes what the cnn producer wanted but i understand why he is making that assumption now i am not going to say he 's right i am not going to say he 's wrong because honestly i do not know i was not on that phone call i do not know what the cnn producer said then what i can say is the debate is much more complicated because what we have here are at least two instances potentially three where people survivors and families of those who survived the florida shooting are on the other side of the gun control debate certainly this debate has been complicated and been going on for a very very long time it 's not like all of these people are naturally going to support gun control but just because i do not know enough does not mean that you do not so let me know what you think in the comments below and we will keep the conversation going how do you feel about the media framing of gun control following the shooting do you feel the media has been predominantly in favor of gun control or do you think that it 's been balanced i know that when you look at fox news it comes off a little bit more balanced in favor of people who are not for gun control and when you look at cnn and other sites it seems like they are more for gun control but what do you think am i wrong is this what 's happening is this just the two realities we will keep the conversation going if you want to follow me i am on twitter at tim cast stay tuned new videos every day at 4 p.m. and i will see you all tomorrow,0.58
you know $ 300 million to have that all year long what 's crazy is that that 's worth it to coca - cola like it 's worth it to pay whatever the number is you know what i mean like insane amounts of money just to have a huge coca - cola billboard at the top of time square because in all of our you know monkey brains that goes like legitimacy i mean look they are up there in these big lights and that 's worth it to them to pay and so you just notice this in general with like like what you were talking about with people who come up in public schools and the way they are propagandized it 's like they are taught to you know like when they accuse people of um dog whistles like they are taught to hear dog whistles that that person is not even whistling right that person might you know like make america great again you know what that means you know when america was great you know what they are saying they are saying enslave you even though that was never said like if i if i were to go and give a talk at a college uh campus which i never will uh but let us just say hypothetically i was invited to go talk to like regular liberal arts college kids i mean they are so it 's not that they would hear my argument and then say no look we have a counter argument that we disagree with you we have been taught this or whatever it 's that they 'd hear what i say and they 'd immediately know in their soul that what i am really trying to say is that i am a terrible person i am a bigot or you know what i mean like they are trained to already dismiss your argument before you can even make your argument or anything you know if you say if you say blacks instead of you know african - americans or whatever they already hear you are a bigot if you were if you say something like it you know whatever the argument might be you can not even get to that argument because they are already trained to be like you know this pavoni like trick of like nope,0.1134,well that 's interesting because trump trump trump president trump donald trump trump donald trump donald trump has been president president trump caitlyn where are we right now in this sentencing proceeding donald trump trump trump we have a donald trump donald trump when it comes to donald trump trump and uh trump donald trump missing from that is donald trump you know trump trump focus on donald trump trump trumpism trump a lot of trump all right so 399 times and you might go well why are they doing that i thought they hate,0.4179,says that the editorial board is composed of journalists with wide - ranging areas of expertise their primary responsibility is to write the times editorials which represent the voice of the board its editors and the publisher the board is part of the opinion department which is operated separately from the times newsroom and include the letters to the editor and the op - ed sections the naturally white identitarian are angry that someone like this would be hired in the new york times espousing these anti white identitarian values and people who are anti identitarian are concerned that she is identitarian and bringing her opinions to the new york times now i need to explain to you the ward at edit area because i think a lot of people do not understand it oxford defines it as relating to or supporting the political interests of a particular racial ethnic or national group typically one composed of europeans or white people and the reason they say typically concerning white people is because right - wing and white identitarian tend to embrace the term identitarian however people on the left do not really call themselves that they do not really necessarily have a word for what they are though they embrace identity politics and when they support the values of particular ethnic or racial groups that is an identity rhian value and thus anti identitarian x ' people who do not like identitarian politics are concerned that this woman is going to bring these kinds of race - based ideas to the new york times the federalists wrote an article highlighting many of her tweets titled new york times hires left - wing writer with long history of racist tweets the new york times editorial board on monday announced the hiring of sarah jean a left - wing writer with a long trail of racist tweets they highlight a few of the tweets i have already read such as speaking of white people are genetically predisposed to burning faster and then calling them groveling goblins the one where she calls them dumbass effing white people but then there 's this tweet where she shows a chart that as you become more white you also become more awful another tweet where she says theoretically you can not be racist against white people but lol how else to describe the weird dog smell rumor racism is defined on google as prejudice discrimination or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one 's own race is superior and thus this is where we have a debate as to whether or not she 's racist is she saying that her race is superior to white people or that white people are inferior some people argue she 's not the left views racism as prejudice plus power therefore she feels she can not be racist towards white people and many people on the right tend to use the word racism to define being prejudicial against someone based on race aside from calling white people groveling goblins and saying white men are she also adds it must be so boring to be white if she 's going to make derogatory statements about white people calling them boring calling them saying cancel white people i 'd have to imagine she holds them in a less than favorable light or genuinely believes white people are inferior in some way and at noon the new york times issued this official statement our statement in response to criticism of the hiring of sarah jean we hired sarah zhong because of the exceptional work she has done covering the internet and technology at a range of respected publications her journalism and the fact that she is a young asian woman have made her a subject of frequent online harassment for a period of time she responded to the harassment by imitating the rhetoric of her harassers she sees now that this approach only served to feed the vitriol that we too often see on social media she regrets it and the times does not condone it we had candid conversations with sarah as part of our thorough vetting process which include a review of her social media history she understands that this type of rhetoric is not acceptable at the times and we are confident that she will be an important voice for the editorial board moving forward and there 's an issue with this because the new york times fired quinn norton over statements she made several years ago as well it would seem like there might be a double standard in the issue of quinn norton she was brought on to be an op - ed writer but because she used certain language certain words that were deemed offensive she was let go there was also concerns that she was friends with people who are all trite or white prem assists quinn norton defends this by saying by being friends these people she can try to pull them away and has staunchly advocated for them to change their ways and the language she used was the language of fortune and hacker communities in which she has to be a part of if she wants to have respect with these people and communicate effectively but even though she had real reasons for what she did it was not considered enough in this instance sarah zhang made several statements in the other direction attacking white people and the new york times has come to her defense it could be that the new york times is biased and they are going to support someone who is left - wing or more likely to align with certain left - wing values or it could be that the new york times is tired of bending over backwards to outraged moms in any case this is more evidence to suggest that the outraged mob tactics are slowly not working it is possible that they just do not work in this instance because the new york times does not care about what conservatives think,0.1835,in milwaukee a black police officer shot a black man who attempted to flee from him while carrying a stolen gun and then turned on the officer riots have ensued meanwhile in baltimore the department of justice has declared the city 's police department which is majority - minority with a heavy concentration of black officers racist all of which raises a question the hell are police departments supposed to do the left has created a catch-22 for itself while rioters declare their intention to target white milwaukee residents and scream about black power while burning down a gas station the media maintained there 's no racism here it 's just a response to generalize police racism but black people are incapable of racism what you have to say about black police officers who they then say are actually racist there are two possible reasons why the left can claim the black police officers are capable of racism but black protesters and black riders are not first leftist can claim the black police officers are not really black they like black republicans have been corrupted by the racist system german lopez of voxcom he wrote bad he wrote this back in april he said quote racial bias is not necessarily about how a person views himself in terms of race but how he views others in terms of race particularly in different roles throughout his everyday life and systemic racism which has been part of the us since its founding can corrupt anyone 's view of minorities in america policing tactics can also create and accentuate personal subconscious bias by increasing the likelihood officers will relate blackness with criminality or danger leading to what psychologists call implicit bias against black americans combined says lopez this means the system as a whole as well as individual officers even black officers by and large act in ways that are deeply racially skewed and potentially racist penny convenient logic police department 's make black officers racist against blacks but what sheriff david clarke terms the ghetto mentality does not generate black racism against white reverse racism lopez says is impossible then there 's the second possibility black police officers are not turned into racist by police departments police departments are actually just the enforcement mechanisms for a racist society that 's the perspective of former obama green jobs are van jones he once told me in a cnn greenroom that black americans jumped to conclusions about cops because quote you are jewish right would not you jump to conclusions if you heard that the nazis or hamas that killed a jew really he said this in this view american society is irredeemably racist those who wear police uniforms are just brown shirts out enforcing that racism all of this is super dangerous it would explain also by the way why looters and rioters attacked shops owned by black americans those shops are just tools of the evil racist capitalist system holding down blacks if the entire system is corrupt any instrument of the system must burn from cops to gas stations one thing is certain the conflict between cops and black riders it will not be calmed by additional police training it certainly will not be calm by politicians continuing to push the myth that police are racially targeting black men for no reason the only way such conflicts will be calmed is ironically the only way the left will never tolerate stronger more prominent law enforcement and cooperation with local communities and the left will never allow that and so the racial conflicts will continue black americans of course will be the ones who pay the price i am ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show all right,0.5627,so the wall street journal has a couple of reports detailing the rest of the sort of bobolinsky story one the headline says hunter biden 's ex business partner alleged father knew about venture however corporate records reviewed by the wall street journal show no record for joe biden according to the wall street journal the biden campaign denied that joe had any involvement in this chinese venture with his oil company or stood to gain by it babalinski said he was ranked by joe biden 's public statements he never discussed the international business activities of hunter and other family members he also cited nearly five million dollars in payments a senate republican report last month said that cefc made 200 biden 's law firm as another reason to come forward babalinski said he took part in a meeting with hunter joe biden and joe biden 's brother james biden in la in 2017 when they discussed the biden family business plans with the chinese of which joe biden was plainly familiar at least at a high level a biden campaign spokesman do not immediately respond to a question about the alleged meeting with babalinski james biden and an attorney for hunter biden do not respond to requests for comment and then they of course issued from the campaign this blanket denial text messages and emails related to the venture that were provided to the journal by bob linski mainly from the spring and summer of 2017 do not show either hunter biden or james biden discussing a role for joe in the venture mr gilliard who is one of the partners told the journal i would like to clear up any speculation that former vp biden was involved with the 2017 discussions about our potential business structure i am unaware of any involvement at any time of the former vp the activity in question never delivered any project revenue and which sounds like maybe just maybe the project was on the road and then it sort of fell apart kimberly strassel has a report over at the wall street journal on this she says that bobolinsky 's text messages show he was recruited for the project by that james gillier character a hunter associate gilliard explains in a december 2015 text there will be a deal between the chinese and quote one of the most prominent families from the united states a month later he introduces rob walker also a partner of biden in march 2016 gilliard told the babalinski the chinese entity was cefc which was shaping up to be the goldmans of china meaning goldman sachs he later promised that same month to develop the terms of a deal with hunter at this point joe biden of course was still vice president as the deal began to take shape in 2017 bobolinsky began to question what hunter would contribute besides his name and worried he was quote kicked out of the u.s navy for cocaine use hillary acknowledged skill sets missing and observed that hunter has a few demons he explained that in brand hunter is imperative but right now he 's not essential for adding input hunter was hardly visible through most of the work until final negotiations ramped up in mid - may he brought in his uncle jim biden for a stake hunter and texan emails wanted offices in three u.s cities significant travel budgets a stipend for jim a job for an assistant and more frequent distributions of any gains and of course he explained that he wanted a hell of a lot more than 850 000 per year because his ex - wife would nearly take all of it hunter repeatedly made clear that his contribution was his name he railed at babalinski that the cefc heads are coming to be my partner to be partners with the bidens he then reminds him that in this instance only one player holds the trump card and that 's me may not be fair but it 's the reality because i am the only one putting on and putting an entire family legacy on the line joe biden claims he had never discussed his son 's business but of course there was that may 2017 expectations letter including that 10 4 quote unquote the big guy in one text hunter said quote my chairman give an emphatic no to a version of the deal bobolinsky suggested that the chairman referred to joe biden the deal fell through on the chinese end in the summer of 2017 .,0.6408,"turkey qatar has serious connections with hamas that that is why the kamas leadership was until very recently staying in qatar qatar plays all sides of every field they pour money into american universities they pour money into soccer teams they host the olympics right they they host the world cup they do all of these things in order to shield themselves from criticism but they effectively are an iranian katpa the united states could easily say that we are going to remove our air base from qatar if qatar does not pressure kamas to release the hostages the united states could also take measures against turkey the government of turkey which is an islamist government currently supporting sunni isis members in syria among others and currently playing host to wounded kamas members and kamas leadership we could simply say to them listen whatever membership in nato you have is going to be immediately revoked unless you guys get on board expel kamas and force kamas to release the hostages that could certainly be something in terms of on the ground action let us say that there is no incentive structure from outside the gaza strip that could actually be brought to bear on members of kamas inside the gaza strip there 's still things that the united states could do number one the united states could theoretically relieve pressure on the israelis to perform humanitarian aid functions that hamas is stealing one of the things that hamas has been doing one of the things keeping hamas alive is the massive amounts of humanitarian aid that are being shipped into the gaza strip and that are subsequently being stolen by hamas now hamas does not care if its own people starve hamas does not care if palestinians die on mass in fact that was the entire purpose of the war their goal was to kill enough israelis to prompt a ious military response in the hopes that israel would end up mass killing civilians that hamas could claim that it was the victim and then get the world on board for actions against israel that was their pretty open goal so they do not care if kamas affiliated civilians or non - affiliated civilians die in the gaza strip however it is true that hamas has been making its money by stealing humanitarian aid at point of gun and then reselling it to people in the gaza strip or seizing the aid and using it for themselves if the united states were to say listen no more humanitarian aid until the hostages are given up at the very least least hamas would be deprived of its lifeline and its monetary supply and then there 's a proposal that 's been put forward by eugene kovich who is a legal scholar from israel this is a proposal that i think would probably be the most successful proposal this is a proposal that suggests that the thing that hamas and and terrorists in the palestinian authority and that us care about most is grabbing more and more and more territory if however that were to reverse if holding the hostages were to result in more territory being annexed by israel with the permission and acquiescence of the united states then that would actually reverse the polarity see the thing is that if you are going to exert pressure on kamas you have to find something they care about they do not care about dead civilians they do not seem to care about money very much obviously because the israeli government has been offering a reward of $ 5 million for any person who frees a hostage and instant transport out of the gaza strip but kovic points out that one of the things that the united states could do he says for every day hamas does not give up the hostages america could recognize 100 square dunam of gaza as a permanent israeli buffer zone for every murdered hostage 1,000 square dunam and then do it the war would be over in days a dunam is uh approximately a quarter of an acre so basically for his suggestion is that for every single day that kamas does not give up the hostages america recognizes that 25 square acres of gaza disappear they just they become part of a buffer zone in which nobody lives in the gaza strip and the territory just keep shrinking so hamas would have achieved the reverse of its supposed goals in this war which was to extrap the state of israel instead they would be extraa their own territory this is easily the best suggestion by korovich the bottom line is that the entire orientation of the trump administration is very different from the biden administration when it comes to this conflict the biden administration keeps trying to play havies with terrorists over and over and over in fact it was the biden administration playing haves with terrorists that led to the breakdown of the ceasefire between hezbollah and israel yesterday so basically that ceasefire which was signed just about a week ago that ceasefire gave israel the ability to continue to do anti - terror operations ifah were to ship weaponry or personnel south of the lani river in lebanon and the biden administration has been yelling at israel for enforcing that so basically the biden administration position is that actually willly nilly violate the ceasefire by shipping both personnel and material south of lani with the acquiescence or in spite of any resistance by the lebanese armed forces and that israel could do nothing well the minute that the american government said that publicly that now gave hisbah every ability to do exactly what it wanted to do and up the anti again and violate the ceasefire which is why yesterday hisbah fired at israeli controlled territory for the first time since the ceasefire was reached last week prompting israel to launch a wave of air strikes in lebanon as each side blamed the other for violating the tenuous truth the israeli military said toah projectiles fell in open areas without causing casualties the lebanese armed group said its launches had been prompted by quote repeated violations of the agreement by the israeli enemy describing it as quote an initial defensive response that serves as a warning now again the reason that they are doing that is because fah terrorists have been crossing the lani and they have been shipping in material and they have been moving up on the lebanese border once again the only reason they think they can get away with that is because joe biden is a fool and a simpleton and so are the rest of the members of his foreign policy administration",1.1244,but i 'd like to because it 's very nice to be here with you feminists have attacked that traditionally feminine virtue as well now they have insisted that women be promiscuous that women go out and treat sex just like men do but the trouble is men like casual sex a lot more than women do and a lot of what you are seeing on campus the so called campus rape epidemic is not so much about rape it 's about consensual relations that maybe involve a little too much booze or a little too much of this or that and a lot of bad ideology so in a lot of these campus so - called rape hoaxes we have found out from text messages or emails or phone calls that very often women will go back to the man 's room they will they will engage in certain sexual acts that are perfectly consensual and then the next day they will not regret it and say this was rape because i do not really want to do it or i wish i have not done it or i drank too much or whatever you want to say the the cause of this obviously this is not to say that men should ever feel that they can get aggressive or if a woman says no that they should be able to have sex with her anyway that that is totally that 's the point that feminists want to focus on that is not the point the point is that second wave feminism has made these women miserable studies show this from the 1970s all the way to i think the study goes up to around 2010 we see that women become much less happy during the rise of second and third wave feminism that 's true in relative terms that 's true in absolute terms not just relative to men but absolutely their happiness has decreased a lot of this has to do with the denial that men and women are different and just as a matter of talking about the virtues of men and women it seems to me an insane notion that developed in the 60s and 70s that the only way for women to be free to be equal to be living their best lives is to pretend to be meant to be a worse version of men to be aggressive to be promiscuous to be what all of some of the worst characters and characteristics of men that women would adopt this seems crazy to me even just on that question of promiscuity and the virtue of modesty in it is true there 's a sexual double standard that this has been true for ever men get away with more they get away with more casual sex and women take them back and this is not through the other way around the traditional response of women to this is to try to get men to stop being such dogs to stop being such cads but the response of second wave feminism changed that flipped it on its head and said women should be dogs two women are in any better than men in that regard but in that regard really they are traditionally all of this is to say when you you rode the distinction between men and women you end up with transgender ideology that ironically guts feminism itself i am not when i talk about transgenderism i am not talking about the handful of people who are confused psychologically about their gender they they are a man he 's a man who thinks he 's a woman or he very much wants to be a woman that we are talking in that case about 2.2 2.4 percent of the population at the wildest estimates i am not talking about those people i am talking about the etiology of transgenderism which is being foisted on us by leftist activists which is why 0.2 percent of the population is dominating the national conversation about the sex it 's because it 's not really about helping those people at all what it 's about is erasing the difference between men and women,0.3615,i repeat it 's it 's totally crazy he himself asked wisconsin and michigan to take him off the ballot because he 's not running in wisconsin or michigan and he does not want to take votes away from donald trump and democrats who are in charge of the electoral me mechanisms in wisconson and michigan turned him down and said your name will stay on the ballot even though you have asked that it not even be on the ballot so that people will make a mistake maybe and think and then vote for you absolutely nuts according to axios robert of kennedy jr will be on the ballot in the battlegrounds of michigan and wisconsin in november even though he has suspended his bid and backed former president trump kennedy suspended his campaign to avoid taking votes from trump now his name will appear on the ballot in the various states that could decide the election kennedy has been removed in arizona nevada and pennsylvania he will apparently stand the ballot also in north carolina a super competitive state a combination of state laws and overdue deadlines explains why kennedy has not able to remove his name from the ballot in some states sher hardman senior press secretary for michigan secretary of state joselyn benson who is a democrat of course said a minor party candidate can not withdraw in michigan meanwhile the wisconsin election commission voted on tuesday 5 to1 to reject kennedy 's request to withdraw from the ballot so they are keeping him on the ballot even though he can he can not even really receive votes he 's not a candidate meanwhile the same people who are attempting to keep rfk jr 's dead candidacy on the ballot they are attempting to force cornell west and his live candidacy off the ballot according to wdet.org quote independent presidential candidate cornell west must appear on the ballot in the battleground state of michigan a judge ruled about a week after west was disqualified in michigan the state democratic party democratic secretary of state joselyn benson and a voter back by a democratic align pack had challenged west 's candidacy so remember joselyn benson is the same person who just said one second ago rfk is a minor party candidate he must stay on the ballot even though he does not want to be on the ballot she is trying to get cornell west kicked off the ballot even though he does want to be on the ballot do you understand this how democracy works according to democrats vote for us or it 's not democracy they are literally attempting to rig the process in michigan this way that 's insane they are doing it right out in the open they are not even trying to hide it j benson is so corrupt that she is trying to maintain rfk jr on the ballot in michigan after he withdrew from the race and she is trying to get cornell west kicked off the ballot in michigan even though he wants to stay in the race why because if rfk j 's name is on the ballot some republicans might vote for him and of cornell west 's name is on the bel some democrats might vote for him totally insane totally totally crazy cornell west by the way revealed on a podcast that um the democrats had just basically offered to pay off all his bills he would drop out were he offered a position in the harris administration any financial incentives to drop out,0.3425,no one knows how to do it you have linked the the attack on essentialism in some ways back to the the wholehearted belief in evolutionary biology and darwinism the idea that because human beings supposedly evolved from prior species and are evolving into future species that there are no actual hard boundaries around what constitutes a human nature there 's no such thing maybe even as a human such thing as human nature there 's no such thing as a dog 's nature either if you are a committed believer in darwinian evolution because there 's no such thing oh fall at the bottom as a species how could there be a species in darwinian terms darwinian theory holds that there are a continuum of animal forms which gradually imperceptibly shape one into the other the dividing line between the dogs if you go back and back in time does not end abruptly it merges into what came before the dogs there 's no point where you can say that one is not a but that one all of a sudden is a dog that 's anathema to darwinian thinking makes no sense and do not worry in turn it happens to be true could you make the argument if you are an evolutionary biology defender you are darwinian defender could you make the argument that sure over the course of time there is evolution from one species into another there 's an origin to species and then there 's determined there 's not really a terminus of species it evolved into further species but in any given point if you stop the clock right now and you looked at species you could actually draw distinctions between the species because you are not looking at now a time bound phenomenon you are looking at today you are not looking at over the course of history one species evolving into another you are just looking at how to categorize things now so could you accept the premises of evolutionary biology and also accept essentialism it 's tough it 's tough you have to go through the contortions you just underwent and that elegant sentence you have to say let us stop the clock let us look at objects as they are today friday at roughly 11 o'clock as soon as we say but the theory of evolution is a dynamical theory it 's a theory about what changes over time and you and you search for a panoramic view of what 's happening over time that sense of sharp boundaries necessarily must disappear there is no room in darwinian theory for an essential view of the dog 's nature there 's just no room for that you can say right now short dogs or dogs and people are people i could see the difference sometimes good because do not a hey you can see the difference but that 's not the theoretical question the question is is that difference simply an appearance an artifact of evolutionary drama or is it something fundamental is there something irrevocably doglike in the dogs me i think there is so in your book human nature you you launch a series of attacks on widely read evolutionary biologists and philosophers and deconstructionist think that attacks meditations harsh meditations on a variety no not harsh harsh i reserve for my friends well you you talked about many of these these philosophers and you are and it 's sort of an attack on the their attacks on essentialism you it 's it 's it 's it 's at least a a contemplation of their attacks on essentialism from a variety of angles and i want to go through some of those should not talk about exactly what your critiques are so you begin the book by talking specifically about steven pinker the evolutionary biologist at and sociologists over at harvard university his argument seems to be that since the end of world war two that really since the enlightenment he has a new book called enlightenment now in which he argues that since the enlightenment human beings are getting better we are constantly getting better and this is reliant on our own ability to change ourselves i have my own critiques i find his argument both incoherent and historically illiterate in terms of his willingness to read out of history some pretty awful things in history that have happened over the past few centuries but what is your what is your chief argument with thinker well let us put it this way in a in a certain way i think steven pinker is absolutely correct things have gotten better with respect to certain parameters we live in a time of great material abundance perfect ease a good deal of domestic tranquility appearance is notwithstanding antibiotics have been an enormous success in medicine life expectancy has inched up slightly it 's been a tremendous improvement with respect to poverty in the third world just astonishing improvement most of it due to agricultural revolutions the green green revolution all this is unquestionable and i have no interest in questioning it my interest in pinker and my critique of pinker depends on what historians call periods what is the right period to assess the times in which we live if it 's yesterday i have no argument whatsoever things were pretty good yesterday they are pretty good today who am i to complain who is humanity to complain the 20th century though has not slipped into the past very good english philosopher collingwood said that the chief goal of 20th century philosophy is to explain the 20th century and we can not do that the 20th century is not part of the species present we do not live in the 20th century but the period from 1940 to 1945 is extremely somber and a full assessment of the times in which we live must confront what took place in europe and the world during those 30 years it was in fact a repeat of the 30 years war from 1618 to 1648 in the 17th century it was the worst century in human history in terms of excess deaths but beyond any of that terrible as those things were the 20th century introduced a new principle into political and social life a principle of terror and we have not understood that in any way we have failed completely or even partially for example to grasp the meaning of the holocaust and to say well things have improved since 1950 certainly true in certain measures and ignore the rest of the 20th century which is part of our living past as the 19th century no longer is seems to me a profound historical mistake it is not a serious kind of analysis my problem with with pinker that i have talked about in my own book in it with regard to his view of the enlightenment is that it seems incoherent in a couple of ways first he dismisses religious background of the enlightenment as though it never existed is that the enlightenment sprang full - blown out of people 's heads with no back our throat and that that that foolishness he also tends to dismiss the fact that the the enlightenment that he loved so much also had to do with the french revolution which do not go particularly well and had to do with many of the movements that would end up destroying most of the globe in in the 20th century as well meaning there 's some pretty good stuff about the enlightenment namely the american founding the belief in human freedom from government and all of us and then there 's some pretty dark things about the enlightenment as well there 's a dark sides in the enlightenment when you completely disconnect it from eternal moral values and my problem with pinker is that all the stuff about the enlightenment that he requires to actually be the gas in the tank for the enlightenment is the gas tank that he has already emptied meaning he does not like religion very much he thinks that religion is wrong he does not believe in free will but he relies greatly on the idea that we can change ourselves and that we have changed ourselves in line with with higher philosophical thinking he defines things like increase in human flourishing by terms that would really be relevant and only two people who already believe in a judeo - christian worldview and are basically rejected by most of the rest of the world i find all of that that deeply troubling in fact he engages in you might say the exactly the form of essentialism that so many people attend there are many interesting things to say about the enlightened which of course it 's a very complicated historical and philosophical movement and european thought and it can not be summarized too neatly but vivian gornick writing in the new yorker reviewing a book by primal levy who survived auschwitz she confronts the experience of auschwitz with all the innocence of a woman who simply can not understand what she 's discussing she she says,0.2462,and they do not realize that they wrong it 's two left shoes tell me what the hindus believe in three gods it 's the same they believe the same thing that trinitarians believe hindus buddhists gods they believe in big worship there guys in three if you all do not find that to be troubling i do not know what it is then worship their gods in threes it 's that 's not cool nobody worship their guys in threes in the old testament scholars would argue with you scholars would argue that the trinity is never explained in the old testament it 's not there many trinitarian trinitarian scholars with with admit to in this in their writings that the trinity is nowhere in the old testament explained it is not in the new testament explained it 's not there it 's just not there you know and people like to use matthew 28:19 go you go there for teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit that 's a false scripture it 's a false scripture it 's a fabricated scripture because nobody ever baptized in the name of the father son holy spirit never nobody ever did that and so you have to ask yourself questions why because it was a fabric a description jesus actually said go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in my name that 's why ten days later peter baptized in the name of jesus that 's why they preached in the name of jesus they cast out devils in the name of jesus there 's no other name under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of jesus that 's why the bible says that very clearly because jesus told them to do it in my name he did say in the father son holy ghost that 's why nobody never done anything in the name of the father son holy ghost that scripture only exists in one place in the entire bible and that 's in matthew 28:19 there 's nobody else that even said the words the father son and holy ghost the name of the father son holy ghost nobody ever said that any that is one of those fall scriptures where people are adding the doctrine into the into the english bible same thing with matthew first john 5 or 7 these there are terms for this it 's called a geranium comma i say this a lot it 's the join in karma it was proven that it was added to the later manuscripts trying to interject the trinity into the bible it was removed from every modern translation of the bible and modern meaning that most accurate translations of the bible ones this film from scrolls that predate the the scrolls used for the king james bible they remove that from the english bible why did they remove it because it 's the front of foss scripture now i keep saying it i said it over and over again you know anyway i said said i am green in the face let us see he bucolic,0.451,i am going to stand on my principles perhaps as a prerequisite or in a in a desperate attempt to actually win the primary he was trying to convince the mainstream more default liberal types that he would be there for them as a part of this movement and now he has to stand by it and put his money where his mouth is much to the anger of his own supporters fox news says bernie sanders and jost endorsed abidin for president but any illusions that the move would bring an end to the long simmering tensions between the democratic party 's liberal and moderate wings quickly evaporated in a matter of minutes but let me just stop you right there there is a far left and a liberal wing of the party they do not have moderates anymore they lost them they mentioned brianna joy gray who said with the utmost respect for bernie sanders who was an incredible human being and a genuine inspiration i do not endorse a joe biden i supported bernie sanders because he backed ideas like medicare - for - all canceling all student debt and a wealth tax biden supports none of those additionally gray indicated she agreed that it was almost insulting for biden to suggest lowering the medicare eligibility age to 60 in lieu of adopting universal health care coverage i also think that was ocasio cortez 's something said something similar interesting however they go on to mention shaun king calling out joe biden check this out shaun king tweeted i can hardly believe what i am watching in reference to joe biden and bernie sanders live stream in his conversation with bernie sanders joe biden is clearly reading from a teleprompter it 's supposed to be a conversation i have never seen this happen in my entire life they go on to mention that elizabeth warren who is closer ideologically with sanders still uh this is an older story elizabeth warren has in fact now endorsed bernie sanders so we are seeing the establishment rally around joe biden but the democrats wanted they wanted democratic socialism check this out this is the wikipedia page for the democratic party and as we can see according to ideology factions include democratic socialism and left wing populism progressivism they absolutely wanted these people to be a part of their party they courted these votes they propped up bernie sanders somewhat they actually tried to stop him in many ways but they tried using him they tried bringing some of his policies into into their party in an attempt to win but also bernie sanders did something similar he 's absolutely flip - flopped on immigration at everyone 's pointed it out bernie sanders tried getting these same people as well,0.6081,and you point it out you get strange new respect well justin amash has been receiving that ever since he decided that he 'd come out in favor of impeachment is he actually going to be given that no the democratic leadership does not trust amash with that because they never know what he might say amash is enough of a rogue that he might start going off on the democrats spending habits and invasions of government meanwhile representative jeff van drew who 's an anti impeachment democrat is now going to switch parties this demonstrates again that these democrats are not quite as popular on this thing among independents as they say they are according to the new york times representative jeff andra of new jersey a moderate democrat was among the party staunchest opponents of impeaching trump told aides on saturday he plans to switch parties and declare himself a republican as soon as next week just as the house is casting its historic votes on articles of impeachment and white house meeting on friday the andrew sawed trump 's blessing for the move which could be critical to his ability to avoid a primary challenge next year the president urged him to make the jump according to two democrats and one republican who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the talks were intended to be private andrew has spoken with senior advisors to trump about announcing his switch at an event at the white house either immediately before or just after the house votes on two articles of impeachment which is expected to happen on wednesday according to republicans and democrats now typically when a member of a of a big political party has switched that 's been big news go away back to jim jeffords switching parties and the switching control of the senate of the united states back in the early 2000s but this is obviously big news in the middle of an impeachment hearing you have a guy who is a blue vote in a in a red district in new jersey switching parties because he believes that he 's not going to be able to win re - election if he supports the impeachment the move would provide a silver lining for trump as he becomes the third president ever to be impeached according to the new york times the decision by van who reflects the heavy political consequences hanging over next week 's impeachment vote particularly for moderate democrats and districts that supported trump in 2016 they are out 30 democrats who are sitting in districts that supported trump republicans are targeting those districts heavily the impeachment vote could come back to haunt all of those people jerry nadler for his part leading me house shoe dicier committee ripped into van drew saying that the real reason he 's not doing this the real reason he 's switching is not out of principle it 's out of political fear he 's reacting to is a public polling that shows he can not get renominated the his electorate in in his district is 24 % too renowned 8 him the 60 % and nominate somebody else the more to the point this is not political we should not be looking at those things this is the defense of our democracy do we stay a democratic republic or do we turn into a terran ii what is fascinating here is that members of van drewes own constituency michel suleiman the atlantic county democratic chairman has she wrote a letter to ban druze and i am imploring you to vote in favor of impeachment a no vote on impeachment will suppress democratic turnout down ballot which my organization can not sustain in other words if they try this impeachment and it turns out to come to nothing that could actually suppress the democratic efforts to get out the vote everybody 's so depressed and it is interesting the democrats are this early playing the card that they almost expected trump to win if he 's not impeached that 's the only reason that you put out there the preventative message that if trump is elected it 's a legitimate because you actually expect that he 's going to win meanwhile in the senate chuck schumer is attempting to militate but he has no power in the senate so it does not really matter just as this house thing has been run as a sham the senate thing will be run as a sham also the senate republicans are going to rush this thing through mitch mcconnell senate majority leader he has no interest in dragging this thing out and he does not think that the democrats proved their case in the house so chuck schumer is now trying to force mitch mcconnell to call a bunch of witnesses from the white house those witnesses from the white house already said they are not testifying in front of congress and the democrats could have called them in the house all they had to do is wait this thing out but they refused to wait this thing out because they know they are not going to get it so instead schumer is going to pretend that mcconnell was engaging in a cover - up by not calling the same witnesses democrats refused to wait for over on the house side according to axios com schumer has now sent a letter to mcconnell in which he asks the republican leaders to call for witnesses who refused to testify before the house impeachment committees the witnesses schumer has asked for i will have direct knowledge of trump administration decisions he wants the senate to call mick mulvaney the acting white house chief of staff john bolton the former nsa michael duffy the associate director for national security office of management and budget and robert blair senior advisor to mulvaney the senate democratic leaders request may appeal to some moderate republicans but that obviously is going nowhere and the reason that it is going nowhere obviously is because why exactly would mcconnell call people that again the democrats could have called but would not wait for let us not pretend here the democrats had no authority to call these people some of them they do not even issue legal subpoenas to some of them they were just like here 's a request to show up at the house and these people like no do not think so he 's like obstruction of congress that 's the way this thing has gone so far so it 's a sham the house will vote to impeach i mid - january this thing will be over at the senate you know i will be in the past and people have already taken their stances but there are some varying poll statistics on how popular this is there 's a fox news poll that said 54 % of americans support the impeachment at this point but there are other polls suggesting that it 's well under 50 % the fox news poll is actually a little bit of an outlier suffice it to say that after it fails in the senate,0.3158,so john roberts the chief justice of the supreme court has now acknowledged that the leaked supreme court draft majority opinion decision by justice solidos striking down roe versus wade is indeed legitimate he says however that because it is the first draft it is not a final draft it 's not clear which way the court is going to go or if this decision is going to look exactly like the decision that comes out from the court according to the wall street journal elite supreme court draft opinion written by justice samuel alito and published late monday by politico indicated the court may be preparing to overturn roe versus wade chief justice john roberts confirmed in a statement that the draft written by justice samuel alito was authentic he said it was not necessarily the final resolution of the case he said this is a singular and egregious breach of trust i mean he 's correct it is a singular and egregious breach of trust he would know about that considering that he wrote the obamacare decision justice roberts condemned the league said he had directed the court 's marshall to investigate the matter so we have now reached the timeline where the marshal of the supreme court actually may arrest somebody which is pretty amazing the 67 - page opinion declared was egregiously wrong and deeply damaging the court is expected to actually issue the opinion by the end of june or early july but the truth is at this point the court should just release it the courts just move forward and release this opinion and then we can be done because otherwise this is just going to simmer for nigh on two months and there 's no purpose to that at all in the meantime states are moving in various directions on abortion so you have more conservative leaning states already moving to enshrine the right to life and you are seeing liberal leaning states enshrining the right to abortion all the way basically up until you are about i do not know 67 years old or so according to the wall street journal state political leaders across the country proposed new laws and staked out positions as a leak of a draft opinion indicated the supreme court could soon overturn roe versus wade which would make the legality of abortions a state issue south dakota governor christie nomer republican tweeted tuesday she would immediately call for a special session of rose overturned to save lives and guarantee that every unborn child has a right to life in south dakota and alabama a legislative leader promised quick action to quickly end abortion within our borders meanwhile in new york and california democratic lawmakers say they would push to amend their state constitution to cement existing laws that protect abortion rights completely unnecessary in california and new york considering how left - leaning the state is you do not need an actual constitutional amendment to protect the killing of the unborn but they will do so anyway legislative leaders in california are aiming to put an amendment on the ballot before voters if they can pass the super - majority democratic legislature by june at a rally outside the state capitol in new york governor kathy hokel urged lawmakers to start passage of an amendment to the state constitution in upcoming weeks an abortion rights amendment would have to be passed by legislators in two separate sessions and then be approved by the voters california state senate is also considering a bill that would create a government fund to pay for abortions so in california honestly you get to choose your state see this is one of the wonderful things about federalism one of the wonderful things you get to choose to live in a state that protects the lives of the unborn or you can choose to live in a state where everybody is forced by the government to pay for everybody else 's abortion which is exciting stuff nancy skinner democratic state senator who co - wrote the bill said we do not want people to have to come here but we do not want to leave women in desperation and we do not want deaths well i mean if you do not want deaths and probably you should not support abortion since that is an actual killing of an unborn human being but basically new york and california they want to be attracting people for disneyland abortion in california and for broadway and abortion in new york connecticut governor ned lamont democrat said tuesday he would sign a bill allowing nurse practitioners and other medical professionals who are not physicians to perform abortions via vacuum aspiration and prescribed medication as well and of course you are seeing liberal - leaning states do exactly the same and that includes by the way liberal - leaning states that have republican governors like massachusetts vermont and new hampshire,0.8604,"oh i want everyone to know that i am not terminating my campaign i am simply suspending it and not not ending it my name my name will remain on the ballot in most states if you live in a blue state you can vote for me without harming or helping president trump or or vi or vice president harris and red states the same will apply i encourage you to vote for me and if enough of you do vote for me and neither of the major party candidates win 270 votes which is quite possible in fact today our polling shows them tying at 269 to 269 and i could conceivably still end up in the white house in a contingent election but in about 10 battleground states where my presence would be a spoiler i am going to remove my name and i have he started that process and urge voters not to vote for me it 's with a sense of victory and not defeat that i am suspending my campaign activities not only did we do the impossible by collecting a million signatures we changed the national political conversation forever chronic disease free speech government corruption breaking our addiction to war have moved to the center of politics i can say to all of worked so hard the last year and a half thank you for a job well done three great causes drove me to enter this race in the first place primarily and these are the principal causes that persuaded me to leave the democrat democratic party and and run as an independent and now to throw my support president trump the the causes were free speech the war in ukraine and the war on our children i have already described some of my personal experiences and struggles with a government censorship industrial complex i want to say a word about the ukraine war the military industrial complex has provided us with a familiar comic book justification like they do want every war that this one is a noble effort to stop a super villain latin putin invading the ukraine and then to thwart his hitler - like marge across europe in fact tiny ukraine is a proxy in a geopolitical struggle initiated by the ambitions of the us neocons were american global hemony i am not excusing putin for invading ukraine he had other options but the russia is war the war is russia 's predictable response to the reckless necon project of extending nato to encircle russia a hostile act the credulous media rarely explained to americans that we unilaterally walked away from two intermediate nuclear weapons treaties with russia and then put nuclear where ed ages missile systems in romania and poland this is a hostile hostile act the white the and that the biden white house repeat l spurned russia 's offer to settle this war peacefully ukraine war began in 2014 when us agencies overthrew the democratically elected government of ukraine and installed a handpicked pro western government that launched a deadly civil war against ethnic russians in ukraine in 2019 america walked away from a peace treaty the minsk agreement that had been negotiated between russia and ukraine by european nations and then in april of 2022 we wanted the war in april of 2022 president biden sent boris johnson to ukraine to force president zinsky to tear up a peace agreement that he and the russians had already signed and the russians were withdrawing troops from kev and dumas and lans and that peace agreement would have brought peace to the legion and would have allowed dumas and lugans to remain part of ukraine president biden stated that month that this object that his objective in the war was regime change in russia his defense secretary lloyd austin simultaneously explained that america 's purpose in the war was to exhaust the russian army to degrade its capacity to fight anywhere else in the world these objectives of course have nothing to do with what they were telling american about protecting ukraine 's sovereignty ukraine is a victim in this war and it 's a victim of of the west since then we and of of russia and both russia and the west since then we have since tearing up that agreement forcing seninsky to tear up the agreement we have squandered the flower of ukrainian youth as many as 600,000 ukrainian kids and over a 100,000 russian kids none of whom all of whom we should be mourning have died and the ukraine 's infrastructure is destroyed the war has been a disaster for our country as well we squandered nearly $ 200 billion dollars already and these are badly needed dollars in our communities suffering communities all over our country the nordstream pipeline sabotage and the sanctions have destroyed europe 's industrial base which form the bull workk of us national security a strong germany with a strong industry is a much much stronger deterrent to russia and a germany that is that is de - industrialized and turned into just an extension of us military base we pushed russia into a disastrous alliance with china and iran were closer to the brink of nuclear exchange than at any time since 1962 and the neons and the white house do not seem to care at all our moral authority and our economy are in shambles and the war gave rise to the emergence of bricks which now threatens to replace the dollar as the global reserve currency this is a first class calamity for our country judging by her bellicose belligerent speech last night in chicago we can assume that president harris will be an enthus enthusiastic advocate for this and other neocon military adventures and",0.6837,"so the news of the day is that kamala harris the coronation is complete the democrats are indeed going to try to make fetch happen so you will recall that you ran one of the worst presidential races in history back in 2019 2020 in fact you dropped out before she even received a single vote in the primaries then she became vice president because joe biden needed a black woman on the ticket and then she was terrible and her approval rating was in the low 30s well now because democrats have no other place to turn she 's consolidated the support to become officially the democratic nominee for president of the united states joe biden has been forced out and honest to goodness it 's probably smart of biden to drop at this point given the fact that he was almost certainly going to lose donald trump in november now he can at least wash his hands of it he 's not going to be blamed for the loss now there might be some retrospective blame cast upon him if kamla harris ends up losing for number one picking her as vice president and for number two not getting out of the way earlier to allow for a serious democratic process but given the fact there is no democratic process given the fact that democrats at the party elite level have decided to simply force kamla into place it is what it is and joe biden is now out of the way he is no longer the story other than his absence and the fact that he 's still president of the united states which we will get to later it turns out having a missing president of the united states who goes absent for weeks at a time is probably not a good look to the rest of the world but in terms of campaign 2024 it is all about kamala according to the washington post a majority of democratic delegates have now pledged to support vice president harris as the party 's next presidential nominee signaling she 's likely to secure the nomination next month as of monday evening 2,24 delegates from at least three dozen states had endorsed harris that is out of 4,000 delegates which means she has a pure majority ready to go this thing got locked up inside of essentially 48 hours of joe biden dropping out of the race which really suggests that this was all pre - planned now all of these sort of heartburn and an that you were hearing from the democratic party it seems a little bit overwrought in retrospect given the fact that not only did they have the support lined up for kla harris they were basically ready to go with these giant money bombs almost immediately so nancy pelosi yesterday announced her support for kl harris which essentially was the icing on the cake it was the significant nancy pelosi really is the leader of the democratic party the two leaders of the democratic party it was never joe biden barack obama and nancy p are the leaders of the democratic party i mean so much so that it turns out that nancy pelosi was actively intervening in meetings with joe biden as early as 2021 according to the wall street journal president biden had just finished trying to persuade a group of congressional democrats to pass a$1 trillion doll infrastructure bill when nancy pelosi then house speaker took the microphone in 30 minutes of remarks on capitol hill biden had spoken disjointedly and failed to make a concrete ask of lawmakers according to democrats in the room after he left a visibly frustrated pelosi told the group she would articulate what biden had been trying to say according to one lawmaker that was october 2021 that was the la that month was the last time according to the wall street journal biden met with the house democratic caucus on the hill regarding legislation that was three years ago so nancy pelosi and barack obama have been the de facto leaders of the democratic party since effectively joe biden was elected and with nancy pelosi now endorsing k harris with her now having garnered the support of a majority of the delegates money bombs are dropping everywhere democrats are dropping money bombs on kamla harris they also dropped a giant money bomb on the economy which is how you got you know 40 - year highs in inflation saudi arabia recently ended its 50 - year petro dollar deal with the united states that does have the additional ability to weaken the united states dollar since 1974 saudi has sold oil solely in us dollars which was huge for our global economic dominance well now they 'd

million drop that happened the day that joe biden dropped out of the race future forward has already set aside $ 250 million for tv and digital advertising hundreds of millions of dollars came into play almost immediately which again is a suggestion that this was all pre - planned this thing clicked into place far too fast for it to have been spontaneous in any way shape or form now that does not mean that kla harris has a good strategy here it turns out that she pretty clearly does not we will get to the polling data in just a moment here but according to politico there was a big organizing call between kamla harris and tens of thousands of her supporters this happened on sunday and apparently here 's what happened on the call we need to defend our sister everywhere read the meeting notes obtained by politico it is a thing to have maga world chasing",0.4962,anonymously so in the early days everybody thought bitcoin was basically anonymous and people treated it that way and then websites came up that were selling things that the governments might not necessarily want you to buy and people were using bitcoin for that because they thought it was basically anonymous and then later on we found out that it was not anonymous at all but additional steps were taken to make bitcoin even less anonymous and today most people are just using custodial wallets which are you know it 's not even a wallet it 's just an account and it 's no more private than your you know bank of america or or paypal account in fact it 's even less private than those things because anybody can take a look at the blockchain and see what 's there but luckily there 's other cryptocurrencies out there that do give people more privacy so there 's things like monero which most people are now using uh if they want some privacy but there 's even more exciting techn ies and coins out there there 's another one called zeno that allows anybody to create their own privacy token in which nobody can see what 's going on and if you really want to get the the threel agencies upset or government 's upset there 's a project called confidential layer which is creating a bridge from bitcoin bitcoin cash and ethereum onto zeno so you can take bitcoin with no privacy at all or ethereum with no privacy at all and bridge it permissionless le with no custodian and no central point of attack onto zeno and when it 's on zeno you have very very strong privacy with that as well and so i think that 's going to make a whole lot more privacy come to the entire uh cryptocurrency ecosystem but governments are going to hate that like a manero that i mentioned before it 's preemptively banned from being listed on most exchanges in in most of the world at this point and that 's simply because governments have much less of an ability to spy on people that are using things like monero or xeno and that 's why i am a big fan of things like monero or or xeno today and in fact today i would be embarrassed to promote i am embarrassed to promote bitcoin to people today because the trans are slow expensive unreliable and you have no privacy i 'd be proud to promote something like a monero or a zeno or a zcash or a zcoin or any of these privacy tools out there because those are the ones that provide more individual control to people and more privacy and more economic freedom to people over the world people are claim that bitcoin is freedom money but i am really afraid that they are literally building the financial prison walls around themselves like if you look at what 's going on in el salvador,0.7297,i think it 's safe to say that news itself is frowned upon on youtube they do not like it they even mentioned that in monetization policies news is not going to be monetized you know sometimes it can be sometimes it can not be and when we see big news organizations getting monetized it 's usually because they are in some kind of preferred program or because they sell the ads directive themselves and then those ads appear on the youtube player but let us take a look at youtube 's policy on news specifically violent or graphic content it 's not okay to post a violent or gory content that 's primarily intended to be shocking sensational gratuitous if posting graphic content in a news or documentary context please be mindful to provide enough information to help people understand what 's going on the video do not encourage others to commit specific acts of violence now for the most part i understand yes do not post violent or shocking content for the sake of being violent or shocking but realize that news itself can be violent or shocking and news is in ambiguous territory it may or may not violate youtube 's guidelines when i go and cover events and someone from an tyfa throws fireworks and someone from a conservative group then punches that edge of a person in the face is that shocking and gratuitous is there enough context there well it 's too vague to understand youtube has not taken a very protective stance of news in fact many youtube news channels appear in the lifestyle category or entertainment when you go to youtube news which is youtube 's curated list of news with 33 - point million subscribers you can see that for the most part they have cnn al jazeera abc cbs and other verified news organizations where are the youtube creators who should be appearing in news i will flat - out say it youtube does very little to support its homegrown creators when it comes to news they love to put up youtube read advertisements billboards all over the country in the world talking about their comedians and their original characters and the people who became famous on youtube and they try and saw that but what about news creators sure we see the young turks but do they do enough to help support the new community on youtube the answer is no i do not think they do so that leaves us with the final question conspiracy theories sometimes they are fake news but looking throughout history we can see that there are actual conspiracies that happen at a corporate and government level in which case do we allow youtube to say look for the most part i think most conspiracy theories are kind of weird wacky and can be easily debunked a lot of people who are not journalists who do not understand might publish incomplete investigations and i tend to be i tend to err on the side that conspiracy theories they are likely fake news being made up by individuals and as i have already seen with this story i see some parody accounts trying to fan the flames and encourage this fake news to spread but there will come a time when someone publishes a video that is a conspiracy theory but turns out to be true do we want to give youtube the ability to say we are deleting this for violating our policies does that mean then that only news that comes through established powerful multi - million dollar or billion - dollar corporations is really news that 's a serious problem but let me know what you think in the comments below and we will keep the conversation going you can follow me on twitter at tim cash stay tuned new videos every day at 4 p.m. some more trips upcoming it 's getting nice out it 's actually pretty hot in new you all it 's not really hot,0.1799,that approval for long - term use was not based on any studies according to a 60 minutes report in 2019 quote equally suspicious but legal was the large number of key fda regulators who went through the revolving door to jobs with drug manufacturers close quote the opioid epidemic has to date left half a million americans dead this same compromised regulatory system allows big pharma to pay for and play a key role in performing the very studies that lead to the authorization of its own products for decades it was not just common for authors of studies to receive payments from the very companies making the medicines being tested it was also systematically hidden drug companies secretly ghost wrote studies of their own drugs goldacre shows how they conscripted academics to pretend they had authored them the papers were then submitted to mainstream journals whose impressure would give the study 's credibility allowing these drugs to become quote the standard of practice 16 of the 20 papers reporting on the clinical trials conducted on vioxx the anti - inflammatory and pain medication that got fda approval in 1999 then was taken off the market in 2004 for causing heart attacks and strokes were ghost written by merck employees then signed by respected scientists merck ultimately agreed to pay out 4.9 billion in vioxx lawsuits the academics who lent their names to the studies could then stuff their cvs with these articles receive promotions and hire salaries within academia and ultimately ultimately get more consulting fees from pharmaceutical companies at which point they are seen as quote experts by a trusting public in the current regulatory environment companies run the studies of their own products a danish study found that 75 of drug company self - studies assessed were ghost written a leading u.s editor of a specialist journal estimated that 33 percent of articles submitted to his journal were ghostwritten by drug companies these imposters do not get adequately investigated by congress because the pharmaceutical and health industries are now the highest paying lobby in the country having doled out at least 4.5 billion in the last two decades to politicians of both parties quote pfizer 's pack has been the most active close quote stat reporter lev feyture writes quote sending 548 checks to various lawmakers and other industry groups more checks than the actual number of elected officials in the house and senate close quote while gold acres book shows the many ways that drug studies have been rigged to deliver certain outcomes one does not always have to rig a study to get the same result among the most common techniques is to delay the reporting of medication side effects until after the patent runs out and then use the bad publicity to sell a new replacement medication which is still on patent polls repeatedly show that the chief concern among the vaccine hesitant is about side effects or at least effects that do not show up right away the latest edition of the standard textbook in the field plotkins vaccine has an excellent chapter on vaccine safety which notes quote because reactions that are rare delayed or which occur in only certain subpopulations may not be detected before vaccines are licensed post - licensure evaluation of vaccine safety is critical close quote post - licensure first requires fda approval so for most vaccines that means more follow - up after the typical two - year approval process at least several years of it in 2018 the new york times pro - vaccine science writer melinda wenner moyer noted with shock that she learned it was not uncommon among vaccine researchers to take the attitude that censoring bad news about their research was necessary and that some who do not were ostracized by their peers quote as a science journalist i have written several articles to quell vaccine angst and encourage immunization but lately i have noticed that the cloud of fear surrounding vaccines is having another nefarious effect it is eroding the integrity of vaccine science in february i was awarded a fellowship by the non - partisan alicia patterson foundation to report on vaccines soon after i found myself hitting a wall when i tried to report on unexpected or controversial aspects of vaccine efficacy or safety scientists often do not want to talk with me when i did get them on the phone a worrying theme emerged scientists are so terrified of the public 's vaccine hesitancy that they are censoring themselves playing down undesirable findings and perhaps even avoiding undertaking studies that could show unwanted effects those who break these unwritten rules are criticized close quote moyer went on to quote authorities who argue that smaller studies and even inconclusive ones often give us the first glimpse of an insight or problem and this is to say nothing of the wider issue if scientists play down their undesirable findings in potentially mandated medicines as moyer found them to be doing they are not just missing opportunities for good science they are potentially generating anti - scientific misinformation quote vaccine scientists will earn a lot more public trust and overcome a lot more unfounded fear if they choose transparency over censorship close quote she wrote by the time moyer published her article in 2018 many americans were already long in the habit of questioning certain elements of their public health in part because of this hornet 's nest of corruption and regulatory capture but this habit could also be explained in part by the general trend in medicine over the past two decades towards recognizing the superiority of individually tailored interventions or personalized medicine which acknowledges the different people have different risk factors genetics medical histories and reactions to medical products it is now commonplace for people to take responsibility for their own health because this is precisely what we have been telling them to do encouraging them to get to know their own unique risk factors for disease based on their own individual histories and genetics vaccines in contrast are a one - size - fits - all intervention administered on mass by those who know nothing specific about the vaccinees or their children and when political and medical authorities change policies from day to day and public health recommendations in one jurisdiction or country differ from those in others questions will be asked the public has been assured that we in healthcare recognize that the era of medical authoritarianism and the ugly practices that led us to require informed consent are behind us this means that whenever there is a treatment on hand the burden of proof to demonstrate that it is safe and effective must fall on those who offer it it means we must never stifle questions or shame people for being anxious i am a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst and i deal with people 's anxieties and their paranoia too many people think the anxious are necessarily weak one medical colleague calls the vaccine hesitant wimps but this is if not entirely wrong a superficial way of understanding anxiety anxiety is a signal it evolved to get us to pay attention to something sometimes an external threat and sometimes an internal one such as an ignored feeling or forbidden thought threatening to emerge from within anxiety can be neurotic it can even be psychotic it can also save your life because dangers do exist when people do not experience enough anxiety we say they are in denial thus in some situations the capacity to feel anxiety can be an advantage which is likely why it 's preserved in evolution in so many animals aristotle understood this very point long ago as he noted the courageous person say a soldier can and should feel anxious he is facing danger after all and his wisdom tells him there is risk what distinguishes the courageous person from the coward is not that they do not worry or fear but they can still manage to move forward into the dangerous situation they can not avoid facing all of which is to say that the presence of anxiety alone is not dispositive of sanity or insanity it alone does not tell you whether the anxiety is well or ill - founded the same goes with distrust sometimes distrust is paranoia and sometimes it 's healthy skepticism as of a september 2019 gallup poll only a few months before the covet 19 pandemic big pharma was the least trusted of america 's top 25 industry sectors number 25 of 25 .,0.5453,you remember that the the obama administration used to fly the gay pride flag during pride month outside of our embassies but only in westernized countries and maybe outside the vatican just to piss off the pope there was none of that in countries that do not really already agree with barack obama and then the white house released a fact sheet a very important fact sheet in which they declared that trans surgeries for kids are necessary that chopping the genitals off of minors is actually a wonderful way of affirming their gender and that hormone treatments are in fact completely fine hormone treatments have no long - term effects now the science says that we do not know what the hormone treatments have long - term effects it would seem doubtful to me whether you can use puberty blockers on a child for long periods of time and for this not to have any long - term effects so the same people who say you have to eat organic at the supermarket because the pesticides on your apple might screw with you say that you can jack up a kid filled with testosterone you can take a little girl and fill her with testosterone and it will have no long - term impact none it 's amazing science according to the white house sheet the information sheet that they have now put out this is mary margaret olan reporting for the daily wire early transgender surgeries hormone treatments and affirmations are crucial for the health of kids and teens who identify as transgender and non - binary which of course is why your kid at school must be taught that they might be a member of the opposite sex and if you object you must never be told about this teachers should be able to separate you off from your kid and indoctrinate your kid in stuff that will ruin their life and you should have nothing to say about it according to this white house because it 's just so important that if a kid expresses gender confusion at any age we immediately meet them at the door with some puberty blockers the white house flagged a resource from the office of the assistant secretary for health on transgender day of visibility intended to inform parents and guardians educators and other persons supporting children and adolescents with information on what is gender affirming care and why it is important to transgender non - binary and other gender expansive young people 's well - being now gender expansive are these medical terminologies gender expansive is transgender a medical term transgender is not really a medical term gender identity disorder is a medical term gender dysphoria is a medical term transgender encompasses everything from people who actually have a condition known as gender dysphoria in the dsm-5 to people who say on any given day that while they are biologically male they feel female on the inside without any long - term symptoms of gender dysphoria without any of the depression associated with gender disorder without any of the other symptoms associated with gender dysphoria so transgenderism is apparently now medical term gender affirming care is a phrase used by transgender activists and media to mask the more grisly sounding transgender top and bottom surgeries including removing a biological woman 's breasts removing a biological man 's genitals sculpting a fake penis on a biological woman facial feminization or facial masculinization and more social affirmation pure re - blockers and hormones also fall under the gender affirming umbrella remember gender affirming care is an orwellian term because what it means is biology denying care they are saying that your gender what you think you are in your head is more important than what your body actually is so to chop the penis off of a 15 year old boy is gender affirming it is not mutilation it is not creating a false vagina that is going to require that person to put an object in that area to prevent it from healing up for years this is literally what happens when you do these surgeries i know we are supposed to pretend that these surgeries are anodyne and antiseptic they absolutely are not they are barbaric in the extreme commentators lawmakers and people who identify as transgender and people who formerly attempted transitions have expressed grave concerns about encouraging children or young people to explore transitions of any kind according to mary margaret olahan nonetheless the office of the assistant secretary for health sheet says quote gender affirming care is a supportive form of health care it consists of an array of services that may include medical surgical mental health and non - medical services for transgender and non - binary people remember these are not even people who identify as members of the opposite sex now you are talking about people who do not identify as a member of either sex you are non - binary you just say i am a genderless widget and now affirmative care is necessary in which we in which we pretend that you are right about your assessment of an objective fact about reality the white house messaging says quote for transgender and non - binary children and adolescents early gender affirming care is crucial to overall health and well - being as it allows the child or adolescent to focus on social transitions and can increase their confidence while navigating the healthcare system so if you cheer a little five - year - old who thinks that he is a she or who is pretending that he is a she or who 's confused about he and she if you just start calling little billy jane and putting him in dresses and have everybody around him mirror this instead of you know watchful waiting seeing if he grows out of it which the vast vast vast vast majority of people who have gender confusion at young ages do instead of that we have to gender affirm by the way europe rejects this europe rejects the idea that watchful waiting is bad in fact the uk sweden all of these places are now moving very harshly away from the idea that social affirmation and hormone blockers and and transgender surgeries for minors are a good thing but the white house is very extreme because this is what they have decided they are going to run on i do not know what insane world they live in where they think that this is a majority proposition but really go for it according to the white house messaging sheet these procedures have been shown to increase positive outcomes for transgender and non - binary children adolescents,0.5697,so we can grill you on our preferred agenda with regard to guns and that 's of course with the media continue to do so one reporter was grilling sarah huckabee sanders yesterday suggesting that the president was not doing anything now as we will talk about the president actually is looking at doing some stuff with regard to guns it may not be all the things the left wants him to do because maybe he does not think those things are going to be particularly effective in stopping mass shootings one of the big problems with a lot of the gun control proposals that are being put on the table is that there is no clear link between the gun control proposal put on the table and the actual lessening of mass shootings the only gun control proposal that the left is really put on the table to to lessen mass shootings is confiscation of all guns which is completely unrealistic it 's never going to happen and then if you say it 's unrealistic and it 's never going to happen they accuse you of smearing shooting survivors or some such nonsense or not caring about the kids who died which again is total crap but here is what it looks like when the media grills the obama administration on gun control working hand - in - hand with both the federal government as well as state and local law officials law enforcement officials on what we legally can do unfortunately we can not just flip a switch but there is a process there we are a law - and - order country and the president is trying to do everything that he can under his capacity to address these concerns and certainly when it comes to mental illness but the minute the media would not have any of that they were just they were just grilling sarah huckabee senators how dare you not have a one - size - fits - all solution to to mass shootings and the answer is nobody does right even obama said that when he was in office and he was pushing particularly gun control proposals like banning ar-15s for example he would say in his speeches this may not stop on mass shooting this may not stop any mass shootings he would say that sort of stuff and the media would just ignore that which leads a lot of donors to believe hey well if that it 's not what you are doing then what exactly are you doing here now look the media obviously have an agenda here they have it and how they cover these stories they have it in the people they choose to interview there 's a katy tur over at msnbc interviewed a guy who said that he was going to become a school shooter but he do not become a school shooter because he do not have access to guns here 's what that interview looked like some people blame this violence on the media or video games or music we call those people morons but there is one thing that would have made it all different i do not have access to an assault rifle i was almost a school shooter i am not a school shooter because i do not have access to guns guns do not kill people people kill people but people with guns kill lots of people you know that,0.5774
versus ten rounds of a 308 or 762 somebody just use a 308 with 10 rounds instead of using a 556 with 10 rounds and it 's going to it 's going to it 's going to tie you up but they do not but these people do not understand anything about ballistics they do not understand anything about guns they just want to raise money off of your constitutional right they want to tax you every way they can and put you in prison if you do not abide by their rules they want to know who has what and who has what when so when they come to confiscate your life and take you to a fema camp they will know what they are up against because now you have provided every firearm that you have they know what ballistic capabilities you have they know everything about you and they open it up to the public so if somebody want to discriminate against you because you own firearms they have public record to say this guy on 45 firearms we do not like this guy we will not give him opportunity he 's a danger to whatever this is exactly what they are trying to do the government has no right to know how many guns you have the government has no right to know that the only right that the government has to know is that if you commit a crime and now they have to get thrusted into an investigation then they can go and investigate and get a search warrant and all of those different things but your own personal protection is strategically withheld from other people but yourself so when stuff hit the fan people do not know what you got when somebody want to come rob you they do not know you they do not know you riding that you got you got that fire therefore they can come in there and get wet up like a like a a tornado and a hurricane in a snowstorm combined if that 's what they want to do but if they could look at your record and say let me say this let me let us put it this way too and i am going to finish it with this just say that somebody was out to get you they want to rob you they go they go on this database and it 's available to the public and somehow they can research and say dude this dude got 20 rifles that 's where i am going when he go out of town that 's exactly what house i am going to hit it 's dumb it makes no sense these people are incompetent they know nothing about laws they know nothing about guns they know nothing about tactics they know nothing about self defense these people these politicians are running around with bodyguards they do not have to worry about personal protection and they trying to rob you of your rights i hope that this does not pass because if somehow it slipped through the house of representatives and get to the senate you know the dummy that 's it that the puppet in chief and joe biden is going to sign whatever they put across his desk if this somehow make it through the senate it 's going to be over ladies and gentlemen our country exists no more um well not really because i ai not buying by none of this stuff i am already telling you all right now i am going to do i need to be the first i am not buying by none of this i am not getting a license i am not doing none of that stuff if you want to come to the crib you know be ready be ready i hope you have you you the ducks in a row,0.1133,i mean it 's just that simple now i may wish that things had gone differently i supported ronda santis as as a voter if i had had a vote in the primaries i would have voted for governor dan santis as i said he is the best governor in america i moved to florida at least in part because ronda santz had kept the state open because ronda sanz helped make florida awesome and so having that level of governance extended to the federal government i think would have been great i think he would have been the best president of anybody in the pack the republican voters did not agree and do not agree by polling data republican voters want season n9ine of the trump show they want to see trump run again they want to see trump beat joe biden they are looking at the polling data and what they are currently seeing is that donald trump is actually leading joe biden in a statistically significant way way the latest harvard harris poll has donald trump up 5347 over joe biden which is mostly fascinating because it means that trump is actually breaking 50 % in more than one poll at this point and by the way in their general sort of republican primary polls and those ones are the ones that are you know being released after dan sanis dropped out of the race we will get to that in a second th those polls had trump up in the republican national primary by 60 plus points over dan sanis in second and haley in third the national polling numbers for trump continue to be durable that is the reason why trump is the nominee if donald trump were trailing joe biden by 10 points in all the polls and if ronda sans were beating joe biden by three points in all the polls i think this race looks totally different but basically since march the republican base has been brought into line on trump because of the unjust cases that are being brought against him in a wide variety of jurisdictions it feels like legal espionage against the trump campaign and republicans get that and the way that they are fighting back against that is by saying let us give him the nomination i get that and you can see that in the polling data beyond beyond that the fact that trump has been durable against biden takes away the chief baton that fellow republicans could use against him for a brief moment in time november 2022 it seemed as though the republican party was finally declaring that donald trump was likely to make them lose that he had lost in 2020 he had lost in 2021 in georgia senate races 2022 went really poorly and so 2024 why why do this thing again and then as joe biden began to sink slowly into the meer it became clear to republicans that actually trump could win and if trump can win there 's no reason to nominate somebody else not only that a wide swath of republicans believe that for good reasons and ill that the 2020 election was not was not correctly decided that in fact trump won or should have won or that the rules were changed in order to make joe biden win which actually is somewhat true some people believe what i think is not true proposition that it was just pure electoral fraud whatever it is republicans are basically treating donald trump as an incumbent in this race and because he 's incumbent in this race he 's getting incumbent type numbers in this race well that that was made clear by the fact that ronda sanz dropped out of the race over the weekend here was governor d santis dropping out by the way this is the right move he did not have a path forward he did not have a path in new hampshire he did not have a path in south carolina getting out now makes sense now he 's getting a lot of flak which we will get to in a second for his campaign in the first place i think a lot of that flak is entirely misguided meaning that the theory of the campaign which is that republicans had basically gotten tired of all the antics from trump and ready to move to the next thing that was not false in january february it became false as democrats targeted trump for destruction and republicans rallied around trump and so the fact that he ran against trump i do not think that there 's anything wrong with running against donald trump in the primaries and all all the kind of trump fans who were angry at other people for running against trump why why especially because again it was a referendum trump won the referendum that 's the end of the story but the fact that that danis would have made i think a better president and more effective president than trump was in his first term or would be in his second term again you can reject that that 's fine but that does not mean that that dan sance is anything wrong by running i also there mistakes that that dan 's campaign made for sure you can say about literally,0.4133,they are all about the signs meanwhile they will send their kids to private school that would be hypocrisy as long as we were talking about the politics of hypocrisy okay in just a second we are going to get to a fascinating article in reason magazine talking about how the country is polarizing on every line i mean like consistently first reminder last friday we announced a partnership with canceled star wars actress gina carano to produce an upcoming film exclusively for daily wear members gina if you are unaware was the star of the hit disney plus star wars show the mandalorian was dropped from the series and by her talent agency after a series of social media posts criticizing the woke mob within hours of us making that announcement the news

conservative podcast and radio show in the nation so meanwhile it is important to note that politics is indeed ruining everything i think this is the biggest problem in the country today really right now is that politics has infused every aspect of our life there is nothing in our lives that is not political and something that you saw with gina carano you can not even watch an entertainment show now without having to think about politics you saw this with sports this is having a dramatic impact on the social fabric it 's something i have been talking about for a very long time it is very very bad for the country and the left has wanted for a long time ever since the 60s when the left declared that the personal is political meaning that whatever you do in your personal life is actively a a political move right your sex life is political what you shop for is political where he went to school is political what this leads to is identity groups based on politics and those identity groups are feel threatened the moment somebody disagrees with them that leads to its hearing a part of the culture see here 's the thing normally an identity group is rooted in immutable characteristics right being black is being in an identity group at the very least because if somebody attacks the color of your skin that is an attack on an immutable characteristic shared by millions of other people if somebody attacks your politics that is not an identity group right politics as an identity group is mutable you can shift your politics people do it all the time so there is a difference between attacking somebody for race and attacking someone for politics but the problem is once you make politics your identity and that identity is expressed in a wide variety of ways across all of american life what you end up with is a mathematics whereby where you shop is political and if i do not shop at your store this means i am insulting you and i am offending you and i have done something wrong to you as a human being reason magazine has a great piece out today by j.d cecile titled politics is seeping into our daily life and ruining everything he runs down some of the data on this point according to a new paper in the journal of public policy and marketing by researchers from arizona state university the university of wyoming and four other u.s universities political polarization is having far - reaching impacts on american life harming consumer welfare and creating challenges for people ranging from elected officials and policy makers to corporate executives and marketers the researchers find that people 's chosen political identities become self - reinforcing through associations with groups with shared beliefs our associations can even create a group shared specific reality that makes it harder to relate to those with opposing views according to the researchers as society has become increasingly polarized politicians objectives diverge and their animosity toward the opposition grows thereby reducing opportunity for compromise partisan incivility is a major reason for failed dialog uncivil exchanges result in disagreement and greater polarization regardless of the evidence presented according to reason people 's partisan identities influence the range of people with whom they are willing to have relationships the brands they purchase and the jobs they take in an era of public health concerns people choose positions on matters like vaccines or mass squaring not based on rational assessment of the issues but on a plug - and - play adoption of their tribes at stances the researchers say with political positions influencing decisions people may sacrifice wages lose out on jobs make sub up sub - optimal purchases and disregard opportunities to save for example research has found that employees accept lower wages to work for politically like - minded entities and people may select higher - priced products or ones that offer less functional value polarization has the potential to prevent neighbors or colleagues of opposing parties from developing friendships this ultimately deprives individuals of intellectual diversity among other things now this all builds on a mountain of data there is a 2018 survey that found that nearly two - thirds of consumers around the world will either buy or boycott a brand solely because of its position on a social or political issue in the united states that number was 59 percent in 2020 there was another survey it reported that 83 percent of millennials find it important for the companies they buy from full line with their values which means that the price and quality of the products is actually secondary which is a problem in the marketplace if you want better things you need competition in the marketplace not based on the politics of the corporation but instead based on the quality of the product that 's how we all get better products the reason you get new iphones every couple years is because android is on their tail but if you have decided that you do not like the politics and android as you are always going to buy the iphone well that just means that you are providing a base for a company that no longer has to innovate christine morman wrote for forbes these leaders hope their political activism will help shape public opinion and potentially lead to lasting change while simultaneously cementing their reputations as moral leaders or change agents since then the trend has only intensified recent events accelerate a broader movement in business to address social and political issues according to a piece in the wall street journal from january pennsylvania state university daniel professor daniel delaposta asked in a study published in june 2020 what if polarization is less like a fence getting taller over time and more like an oil spill that spreads from its source to gradually attain more and more previously apolitical attitudes opinions and preferences even many initially apolitical lifestyle characteristics from musical taste to belief in astrology can become politicized as signals for deeper beliefs and preferences a tendency most saliently captured in the popular image of the latte liberal it also happens to be that when you do all of this what you do is make american life worse because there is no common way that we can share anything if i share a product with somebody i have now poisoned the product this happens regularly by the way there 's a survey that was done fairly recently in which from harvard business review i believe it 's 2018 and they created essentially a focus group and the focus group was made up of conservatives and liberals and people in between and the focus group examined two companies one company well actually three one was a company it 's just called you know generic corp and generic corp had no politics and they asked people what they thought of generic corp and turns out people were okay with generic corp it was fine then generic corp identified as a liberal organization and the numbers were exactly the same people were like,0.182,but they routinely make that argument about systemic racism in america policing is corrupt the criminal justice system is corrupt our politics are corrupt capitalism is corrupt the systemic racism narrative is all about getting people to quote unquote rebel against the system and apparently justify doing so in violent ways and so you have the washington post yesterday here is the headline no matter the verdict in written house trial black residents of kenosha say justice remains elusive no matter the verdict it does not matter if rittenhouse were even convicted they would still say that justice is elusive based on what jacob blake was correctly shot legally he was shot justifiably what what is your evidence here and again no one black was shot in the written house case every single person who was shot was white still the washington post presses forward with the narrative that this is all about race quote more than a year after his nephew was shot seven times by a police officer paralyzing him from the waist down justin blake takes to this city 's broad courthouse steps each morning and makes his case for justice he wants kyle rittenhouse the teen on trial here for murder after he brought an ar-15 to kenosha amid the unrest that follows blake 's shooting held to account he wants the families of the three men written house shot two fatally to know that their pain matters but the thing he wants most will not come to be there will be no trial for the police officer who shot jacob blake now if you just read all that without knowing any of the facts that we have told you about over the course of this particular podcast and show then you might think that this guy is saying things that are are not crazy but everything he is saying is is crazy and written house is being tried he should not be tried because there is no evidence but he wants the families of the people shot to know that he feels their pain they were literally attacking the guy when they were shot he wants the police officer who shot jacob blake put on trial jacob blake was a criminal jacob blake was at his ex girlfriend 's house and there was a again there was a warrant out for his arrest because according to her he had invaded her home and then digitally penetrated her without her without her consent that is called digital rape he had apparently performed that and then he showed up at the house again and she called the cops and the cops showed up and he resisted arrest and got shot for his trouble which is you usually what happens when you resist arrest with a weapon and yet the washington post says black residents want justice do they though because if people wanted justice if this guy wanted justice he would understand that justice would involve not trying the police officer who did the right thing in shooting jacob blake justin blake had tears welling in his eyes as an icy wind rose off the nearby lake fronts i always love when the reporters start describing in transcendental fashion the weather it 's like and then the rain began to pour down on his upturned face it 's like a bad movie they took something from a young man we can never replace and he has not had his day in court i am mad as hell said justin black well considering that one thing that that young man took was um you know the consent of a woman and just allegedly raped her digitally and then threatened the police officer i am going to go with the person who was the villain in that particular case is your nephew i mean by the way it 's it is an unbelievable thing how the entire media jumps to the defense of jacob lake in the middle of that i mean joe biden called the family kamala harris went and visited it was insane it was insane so many are among kenosha 's black community even though few have joined justin blake 's often lonely vigil their absence from the courthouse steps community leaders say should not be confused with satisfaction about how things have gone in the city they have just tried to channel their discontent in other ways the shooting of blake according to the washington post and now 30 year old black man set off mass protests for racial justice here in august 2020 and added to an already febrile moment in cities nationwide following the murder of george floyd it also led to looting burning and upheaval that culminated in the written house shootings well it do not just lead to looting burning and i mean just as a side effect nope that was the effect it was not a mass process for racial when you burn a car lot that 's not a protest for racial justice and by the way it 's not a protest for racial justice when you are suggesting that the cops are racist for shooting an alleged rapist who 's resisting arrest like but the media want the media want their day they i do not unders i am load honestly i am load to credit people with malice where stupidity would serve but this is malicious when you start publishing articles about how black residents of kenosha look at the rittenhouse trial and think that racial justice is not being done i do not know how to given the facts that we now know and are available to everyone i do not know how that is not malice by the media it is i can not i can no longer attribute it to stupidity i would prefer to attribute it to stupidity i can no longer do that this is now malice according to the washington post as the verdict nears in rittenhouse 's trial there 's widespread frustration that the original source of that strife remains unaddressed attempts in the city to confront systemic racism and police brutality have residents say proved underwhelming meanwhile the trial that brought the national spotlight back to kenosha is that of a white man who shot three other white men even as the officer who shot blake rustin chusky has been cleared of charges and resumed serving on the force it 's evidence of an unjust unfair system said alvin owens a black community leader and business owner this is something black america sees all the time but white kenosha white wisconsin white america do not get it they do not know what black america experiences for a brief while says the washington post in the summer of 2020 as americans of all races took to the streets to proclaim that black lives matter owens thought that was poised to change in kenosha he helped organize protests but he says that awareness came and left it was a squandered opportunity again the narrative must be preserved at the expense of the facts and if a few individuals who are not guilty have to pay the price whether it 's the cop and the jacob blake shooting or whether it 's kyle rittenhouse the left does not care they are just obstacles they are speed bumps on the road to utopia alrighty we will be back here later today with an initial hour of content in the meantime go check out the michael knowles show that is available right now i am ben shapiro this is the bench bureau show [ music ] the ben shapiro show is produced by elliot feld executive producer jeremy boring our supervising producer is mathis glover production manager pawel wydowsky associate producer bradford carrington host producer justin barber the show is edited by adam sciavitz audio is mixed by mike coromina hair and makeup is by fabiola cristina production assistant jessica kranz the ben shapiro show is a daily wire production copyright daily wire 2021 the trial of kyle rittenhouse comes to a close though not before the prosecutor can embarrass himself even more kamala harris 's allies accuse joe biden of racism and two - time loser democrat candidate beto o'rourke throws his hat in the ring for texas governor check it out on the michael knowles show,0.562,"joe biden was on the senate foreign relations committee dude 's been in the senate since ko was in the senate and he got into a clash with the prime minister of israel at the time manak bean at the time israel was going into lebanon in order to attempt to extrap terrorism that was coming from southern lebanon again nothing changes when it comes to the middle east and joe biden was very angry at manah bean he lectured manah bean over israeli settlements and manah bean who his entire family was effectively murdered in the holocaust and then he ended up moving to israel and becoming an underground fighter against the british in an attempt to establish the state of israel and then he was out in the political wilderness for a long time finally became prime minister of israel and this is a very famous this a very famous anecdote apparently he then turned to joe biden and he said do not threaten us with cutting off aid to give up our principles said i am not a jew with trembling knees and then he continued i am a proud jew with 3,700 years of civiliz history nobody came to our aid when we were dying in the gas chambers and ovens nobody came to our aid when we were striving to create our country we paid for it we fought for it we died for it we will stand by our principles we will defend them and when necessary we will die for them again with or without your aid now this story is not about manan bean this story is about joe biden joe biden is a coward joe biden is a terrible ter terrible voice when it comes to foreign policy and he always has been there 's a reason that former obama defense secretary robert gates said that joe biden had literally never been correct on foreign policy in his entire life and that is true joe biden has a unique capacity to screw up when it comes to foreign policy joe biden is weak need joe biden is so weak that he brags about being the only member of the biden of the obama administration to oppose the mid laden raid that 's how weak joe biden is well now joe biden is showing his neck to kamas and when you talk about unjustifiable acts on every possible level moral political pragmatic none of it makes any sense on the moral level hamas is a terrorist group that is currently holding five americans there are five americans who are being held in terror tunnels by yak sinir and his group of barbaric thugs their names i know that joe biden does not mention their names very often he will talk about britney griner until the cows come home but when it comes to five americans who happen to be jewish or being held by hamas in terror tunnels then he will not mention their names he will take the occasional photo op with their relatives and pretend that he 's going to stand by them but as we will learn in a moment he ai not stand by nobody their names are eden alexander who is 19 years old om nutra who is 22 hh goldberg poland who is 23 saggy deelen who is 35 and keith seagull who is 64 they are currently being held and joe biden does not give too good dams about any of those people on a moral level joe biden attempting to preserve kamas in rafa is sick on a political level it is political malpractice the american people do not like kamas the american people do not like this conflict but they like kamas even less than they like this conflict they would like to see israel finish this the american people are tired of watching this war go on where in israel is supposed to take it super slow it never ends what america likes are wars that are short america 's that america likes wars that are victorious and those are things joe biden has never been involved in and when it comes to the pragmatic what joe biden is doing right now is the least pragmatic thing i have ever seen a politician do on foreign policy he has created an entire incentive structure for kamas to walk away from the table he has created an incentive structure forah to get into a war with israel he has created an incentive structure whereby by the way if israel goes in more civilians will die so what am i talking about here yesterday in what had been a telegraphed move for the last week or so joe biden went on aon bernett show on cnn and he proceeded to announce that the united states would remove offensive weaponry from israel remember he just signed a bill providing $ 14 billion in aid to israel that bill combined $ 4 billion in aid to israel with some $ 60 billion in aid to ukraine and the way that biden got it over the finish line along with speaker johnson in the house was by combining those elements because it turns out that the republicans are disproportionately anti ukraine aid but pro - israel aid and democrats are disproportionately anti - israel aid but pro ukraine aid joe biden has decided unilaterally that in violation of the impoundment control act of 1974 he is simply going to hold up the shipments of weaponry to israel over disagreements with how israel is prosecuting the war now by the way he has yet to articulate exactly what israel could be doing better or how but none of that matters because we will get to his real agenda in just a few minutes we will get some more on this in a moment first first once again p talk is investing in their customers with their own

ben shapiro show to learn more so he is he 's stumping hard for the gay vote he 's also stumping quite hard for the pro vote he continues to foist on israel a deal that israel certainly did not offer he continues to pretend that israel is making this offer that it never made which is truly an incredible thing he 's playing this game it 's an idiot 's game where he suggests that israel made an offer israel never made the offer then he suggests that should take the offer that israel never made and now he 's going to the un security council to supposedly urge to take the offer first of all a terrorist group you think they give two craps what the un security council has to say what he 's actively attempting to do is have have the un security council force a deal israel did not offer down on israel while claiming that he is doing it on behalf of israel which is the most orwellian garbage i have seen in quite a while meanwhile he 's sending out his state department to claim that israel should not in fact end he 's doing all this because he wants to win some votes in dearborn michigan he does not want the protesters in chicago now what he does not understand is that by prolonging this war if he if the had just let israel finish the job back in february this war would be over already plus there would not be a war on the northern border for israel over the last 48 hours in israel has been firing tons of rockets into northern israel they set the entire northern border on fire literally a giant wildfire in northern israel the tape is pretty astonishing and there 's loud clamor from all sides of the political aisle in israel for israel to go hard in the north none of that would be happening if joe biden have not attempted in order to plate his radical left fringe base by pushing israel into not going into rafa and finishing the job now the real reason that egypt for example does not want israel in rafa is because it 's been clear that for about a decade egypt has been allowing free run of that border in violation of treaty with both israel and the united states egypt does not want that uncovered so they want israel to stop short the biden administration again in a bizarre attempt to pay off is now putting pressure on israel while claiming that it 's putting pressure on it 's absolutely insane israel by the way has pushed back saying we do not make that offer what are you talking about secretary of state anthony blinkin spoke to the defense minister yov galant and war cabinet minister benny gans on sunday to discuss that latest hostage deal notice he 's calling everybody who 's sort of opposed to netanyahu in israel because all the biden administration really wants is to get rid of netanyahu believing that somehow if they do that they are going to earn back the love of the pro voters spoiler alert ai not going to happen in his call with gant blinkin quote commended israel 's readiness to conclude a deal and affirmed the onuses on to accept gan confirmed he had emphas israel 's commitment to dismantling as a governing and military authority and he said that he discussed the issue of identifying and enabling the emergence of a local governing alternative now here 's the here 's the part that that gets a little sticky it turns out has been murdering all of the local alternatives in fact there was a family in gaza palestinian family that had been facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid just went and murdered them all in the end will end up running gaza unless is extrap but biden is openly attempting to stop israel from doing all of that because he is a fool joee biden 's base is that ridiculous convocation of protesters the pro palestinian protesters and the queer trans protesters all facing off in philadelphia that is joe biden 's base that 's what the dnc floor apparently now looks like here is the state department spokesperson ned price declaring that total victory is not possible for israel and they should stop pursuing it well we know that it 's not possible for joe biden or any other apparent administration in the united states for quite a while except for donald trump who actually was able to achieve total victory against for example,1.1032,in the latest proof that modern feminism harms women a new poll shows that a broad majority of men say that women should be drafted into the military 61 % of men think women should be drafted only 27 % of men say no 40 % of women believe they should be drafted so a lot more men than women think women should be drafted presumably there are more females who identify as feminists than men so the question becomes why is it that feminism only runs one way in favor of special laws favoring women when it comes to issues like child care and maternity but against equality of law with regard to the draft here 's the thing men used to understand that one of the main hallmarks of masculinity was the protection and defense of women despite feminist harpies shrieking on like banshees about how women do not need protection treatment to females around the world demonstrates just how dire life is for women when men are not protecting them because then are victimizing them generally men used to take pride in the idea of protecting women they used to think that building a family protecting your wife and children that 's what made you a man in the first place now all that makes you a man is your penis well not even your penis since the transgender movement has declared that biological women can also be men in fact there 's no such thing as manhood in the left 's brave new world other than when you have to blame men for violence or say that we need a female president because men are so terrible of course all of which contradicts itself so why would not men buy into this brave new world in this brave new world the great beneficiaries are men they do not wish to abide by traditional standards of masculinity that 's boring it comes with obligations you do not want the burden of raising kids well good the equality of sex is says there 's no such burden women are independent they can get abortions they can raise kids on their own men do not want the burden of protecting and defending a wife well they do not have to marriage is a patriarchal institution and women can just be lesbians anyway men do not want the burden of protecting women across society by exempting them from the military draft well good news the left has declared that women should be drafted and then siphoned into combat units even if that means lowering the physical standards for service the left can not complain about men wanting to draft women so long as they keep proclaiming that equity of the sexes requires sameness of the sexes or worse if they keep saying sex itself does not exist there are plenty of men who are willing to take advantage of that rather convenient argument i am ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show tend to demonize people who do not care about your

fraud especially with mail - in ballots is no myth and he knows this because he 's been doing it on a grand scale for decades maryland ballots have become the latest flashpoint in 2020 elections while president trump and the gop warned of widespread manipulation of the of absentee votes that will swell with kovid polling restrictions many democrats and their media allies have dismissed such concerns as unfounded but the political insider who spoke on the con condition of anonymity because he fears prosecution said fraud is more the rule than the exception his dirty work has taken him through the weeds of municipal and federal elections in paterson atlantic city camden newark hoboken and hudson county and his fingerprints can be found in local legislative mayoral and congressional races across the garden state some of the biggest names and highest office holders in new jersey have benefited from his tricks according to campaign records the post reviewed an election that is an election that is swayed by 500 votes a thousand votes it can make a difference the tipster said it could be enough to flip states the whistleblower whose identity rap sheet and long history working as a consultant to various campaigns were confirmed by the post says he is not only he has not only changed ballots himself over the years but led teams of fraudsters and mentioned at least 20 operatives in new jersey new york and pennsylvania a critical 2020 swing state donald trump offer this man complete immunity and have him come out and name names please get this guy on public record testifying before congress please have him testify to the fbi or to whoever and and do what you have to do to make sure he can get the weed these people out the new york post says they have confirmed it quote there is no race in new jersey from city council to u.s uh u.s senate that we have not worked on i worked on a fire commissioner 's race in burlington county the smaller the race the easier it is to do a bernie sanders die hard with no horse in the presidential race he said he felt compelled to come forward in the hope that states would act now to fix the glaring security problems present in mail - in ballots this is a real thing he said and there is going to be a effing war coming november 3rd over this stuff if they knew how the sausage was made they could fix it mail in voting can be complicated tough enough that 84 000 new yorkers had their mailed votes thrown out in the june 23rd democratic presidential primary for incorrectly filling them out but for political pros they are a piece of cake in new jersey for example it begins with a blank mail - in ballot delivered to a registered voter in a large envelope inside the packet is a return envelope a certificate of mail - in voter which the voter must sign and the uh and the ballot itself that 's when the election spring the fraud springs in action phony ballots the ballot has no specific security features like a stamp or watermark so the insider said he would just make his own ballots i just put the ballot through the copy machine and it comes out the same way but the return envelopes are more secure than the ballot you could never recreate the envelope he said so they had to be collected from real voters he would have his operatives fan out going house to house convincing voters to let them mail completed ballots on their behalf as a public service the fraudster and his minions would then take the sealed envelopes home hold them over boiling water you have to steam it to loosen the glue he would then remove the real ballot place the counterfeit ballot inside the sign certificate and reseal the envelope five minutes per ballot tops the insider said he took care not to stuff the fake belts into just a few public mailboxes but sprinkle them around town that way he avoided the attention that foiled a sloppy voter fraud operation in a patterson new jersey city council race this year where 900 ballots were found in just three mailboxes if they had spread them in all different mailboxes nothing would have happened the tipster said sometimes postal employees are entering the scam you have a postman who is a rabid anti - trump guy and he 's working for bed working in bedminster or some republican stronghold he can take those filled out ballots and knowing 95 are going to a republican he can just throw those in the garbage in some cases mail carriers were members of his work crew and would sift ballots from the mail and hand them over to the operative they mentioned nursing homes voter impersonation bribing voters it just goes on and on and on he says there 's nothing new about these techniques i am sorry hans von spakovsky said there is nothing new about these techniques he 's a senior legal fellow at heritage who manages their election law reform initiative everything he 's talking about is perfectly possible they say while federal law warns of prison sentences of up to five years busted voter frauds have seen far less punishment in 2018 a texas woman was sentenced to five years an arizona man busted for voting twice in the mail was given just three years probation a study by the conservative heritage heritage foundation found more than 1 000 instances of documented voter fraud in the u.s almost off of which occurred over the last almost all of which occurred over the last 20 years trump may be on track to win he may have everything on his side,0.3293,"and i would say that the clinical psychologists that will cover to begin with are much more concerned with the nature of the implicit structures that shape your perceptions and also the implicit structures that shape your behaviors and how they are integrated in relationship to your negative emotion health and well - being whereas the thinkers in the second half are more concerned about laying out the structural elements of those features and relating them to underlying se mechanistic phenomena making the assumption which seems warranted that there 's some relationship between your personality and the manner in which your brain functions i am going to try to provide you with a meta - narrative that will help you unite these different theories i have often found it useful when i am trying to remember something to have a story to hang the facts on otherwise you are faced with the necessity of doing nothing but memorization and it is not obvious to me that memorization actually constitutes knowledge what constitutes knowledge is the generation of a cognitive structure that enables you to conduct yourself more appropriately in life and so i suppose you might say that of course in psychology you could argue that a course in psychology especially in personality is a course in applied wisdom as well assuming that wisdom is in part your capacity to understand yourselves so that you do not so that you do not present too much of an intolerable mystery to yourself and also to understand others so that you can predict their behavior understand their motivations negotiate with them listen to them and formulate joint games with them so that you can integrate yourself reasonably well with another person and with a family and in society well the structural elements of personality might be regarded as the implicit structures that govern your perception and that tilt you towards certain kinds of behaviors i can give you some examples we can talk about the big five model just briefly the big five personality model is a statistical model which we will cover in detail trade by trade partner partly during the second half of the course the way that the big five was generated was that its tread being generated over about 50 years that personality psychologists gathered together adjectives with in the english language first that were used to describe human beings as many adjectives as they could collect and then subjected them to a process called factor analysis and what factor analysis does is enable you statistically to determine in some sense how similar adjectives are to one another so for example if you gave 1,000 people a list of adjectives to describe themselves with and one of the adjectives was happy and another of the adjectives was social you 'd find that those who rated themselves high unhappy would also rate themselves high on social and those who rated themselves low unhappy would also rate themselves low on social and by looking at those patterns of covariation you can determine what the essential dimensions are of human personality one of the dimensions is roughly happiness that 's extraversion another dimension is neuroticism it 's a negative emotion dimension so if you ask someone if they are anxious and they score high say on a scale of 1 to 7 they are also likely to score on another item that says that they are sad and it turns out that negative emotions clump together and so that people who experience more of one negative emotion have a propensity to experience more of all of them there 's another dimension called agreeableness and agreeable people are self - sacrificing compassionate and polite if you are dealing with an agreeable person they do not like conflict they care for other people if you are dealing with an agreeable person they are likely to put your concerns ahead of theirs they are non competitive and cooperative it 's a dimension where women are women score more highly than men on agreeableness across cultures including those cultures where the largest steps have been taken towards producing an egalitarian social circumstance like scandinavia actually the gender differences in personality there are larger than they are anywhere else another trait is conscientiousness conscientiousness is an excellent trait if you want to do well in in school and in work especially if you are a manager an administrator i can not say we understand a lot about conscientiousness although it it reliably emerges from factor analytic studies of adjectives groups across different countries conscientious people are diligent industrious and orderly they are orderliness tilts them towards political conservatism by the way because it turns out that your inbuilt temperament your inbuilt personality which constitutes a set of filters through which you view the world also alters the manner in which you process information and influences the way that you vote and so you might say and i do believe that this is true or we have been doing a lot of research on this as of late the more accurate a measure you take of someone 's political beliefs the more you find that personality is what 's predicting them and i think that 's a reasonable thing to think about because you know you have to you have to figure out ways of simplifying the world right because you just can not do everything and so people are specialized they have specialized niches that they occupy you can think about them as social niches can niche is a place where your particular skills would serve to maintain you and so if you are extroverted you are going to look for a social niche because you like to be around people and if you are introverted you are going to spend much more time on your own and so if you are an introverted person for example you are going to want a job where you are not selling and where you are not surrounded by groups of people who are making social demands on you all the time because it will wear you out whereas if you are extroverted that 's just exactly what you want",0.2443,but you do not have scripture i am giving scripture i am giving scripture we can i just read the mediation that jesus was the mediator between man and god and people are still saying people are still saying it he 's still god to you were not that saying oh in the catholic church assisted or in the baptist church that says they are in the church of christ says that but the bible do not say that you said it the bible does not say that so myself preachers are over witness witness doctor now preaching on jehovah witness i am preaching the bible did i read the scripture or did i not read description it ai not no doctrine i am reading out of the book i am reading out of the book i am tracking ironman 33 thank you i am tracking so as jesus created or formed well according to the scripture jesus the man jesus was birth on a certain day and he lived and nobody know what he did until he was in his 30s what explain to me this why is there no history of jesus until he 's older there 's a huge gap in jesus 's life from when he 's a baby to when he started his ministry think about this for a minute ladies and gentlemen how would they leave out what god is doing from death to this point at this point is god for crying out loud it 's just according to the trinitarian god is doing things what has god not being documented from being a baby to like a teenager and then 32 years old i am like i do not understand i do not understand but people believe it if if jews believe that jesus was god in the flesh they would have documented everything that jesus did from the time he was 0 to 1 2 3 4 5 6 years old god being a baby is significant if god was baby that is significant history like what was he doing what was he doing that bob if he 's god he has our wisdom unless he was acting like he do not have my wisdom you know it did god not have wisdom and one years old he was god right jesus was god he had wisdom at 1 years old when did he start talking when did he start walking none of that should be bound because he 's got he can walk on water he could do all these things,0.4467,"so the democratic 2020 primaries are a mess for the democrats according to 538 bernie sanders is now a one - in - two odds on favorites to be the nominee for president of the united states for the democratic party and when a majority of the delegates they are forecasting that he will win above a majority of delegates about 1,700 delegates they are forecasting that joe biden will come in second and pete budi judge will come in third they are really forecasting that because they are thinking that biden is going to win a bunch of delegates in the south particularly among black voters see here 's the problem pee buddha judge is indeed surging there 's no question that people who to judge is surging the latest polls in new hampshire show gouda judge actually challenging bernie sanders for primacy the best news here by the way would be for pete buddy judge to win new hampshire outright for biden all right that would be the best news for biden because if he blew to judge wins new hampshire outright i know the conventional wisdom is that then he will go on he will become the moderate lane democrat i do not think that 's correct i think that if people were to judge wins new hampshire the person that hurts most is bernie because bernie is widely expected to win new hampshire if bootie judge wins iowa and he wins new hampshire then you will get the candidates of sort of the white upper upper class versus the candidate who 's more popular with minorities so people are assuming that buddha judge is cutting into biden and there 's truth to that in places like iowa in new hampshire but if buddha judge starts to actually overcome bernie in state after state then what you are going to see is people move away from some of these other candidates to counter buddha judge and that 's why you are going to see by can go after buddha judge tonight in new hampshire the latest poll statistics show that sanders is only very narrowly leading buddha judge the newest boston globe suffolk poll has them in a dead heat it has blue to judge of 23 in sanders at 24 the emerson poll that came out the same day it has sanders further ahead at 32 with blue to judge of 23 and monmouth which came out the day before had sanders within spitting distance of buddha judge sanders at 24 and buddha judge at 20 bottom line is that that lead has shrunk dramatically for bernie sanders who judges getting a big bump from iowa part of that is due to the media coverage bernie did win the most votes in iowa",0.6076,the fact is that the democrats have no new evidence none none zero zip zilch in fact as i say the main revelation from the new book is that christine blasi ford 's best friend does not believe her and not only does not believe her has now suggested openly that she was being pressured by christine blasi ford and allies to go after brett kavanaugh that 's an astonishing story that 's an astonishing story imagine that the same thing had happened about paula jones in the 1990s that there is somebody who paula jones counted on as a witness to her encounter with bill clinton and then that person to come out and say not only do i not believe paula jones paula and her friends in the republican party we are calling me and pressuring me you think that might 've been front - page news but here it 's not front - page news it 's reported but grudgingly late by the new york times here 's how the media have decided to cover all of this so is this story the battery of the near attempts no that 's not the story the story is according to the washington post in action on kavanagh allegations reignites political rancor so you get this yet this is so another empty allegation is put forward with no corroborate of evidence none that was the main topic of our show yesterday than one fire roll okay there is no corroborating evidence whatsoever from anyone who is willing to go on the record we do not know the names of any witnesses to these events who say that they were present the main quote - unquote victims in these cases the alleged victims do not specifically recall the events even supper ramirez who 's now being trotted out as the main witness to a sexual assault she had to spend six days talking with her lawyer and refreshing her memory before she even felt comfortable talking about this whole thing and then you have christine glaze afford whose entire story is doubted by her main witness leland kaiser and the story is not democrats try to reignite political fervor with empty allegations no the story is you know the republicans do not fully investigate these empty allegations how would they invest a real serious question how would you suggest that they investigate an allegation by a guy who provided apparently no details in which the alleged victim does not recall the event how do you purport to go about investigating that you know law enforcement has resources those resources are not endless they do not spend every day tracking down every allegation of misbehavior that is that in which there is no support of the evidence provided but here is the reporting again great reporting over at the washington post by segment kim in action on cavanaugh allegations reignites political rancor four days before brett cavanaugh was confirmed to the supreme court by the narrowest of margins senator chris coons sent a letter to the fbi urging appropriate follow - up on new information he believed was relevant to sexual misconduct allegations made against the nominee then apparently not much happened not at the fbi which assured coons it had received the letter but did not interview the person whom the senator referred to the bureau not in the office of then senate judiciary committee chairman charles grassley republican of iowa which was copied on the letter that contained few in the way of specifics by the way grassley says that they never really even received the letter it is also important i love that that they just sort of by the way it contained very little in the way of specifics maybe that 's why the fbi do not spend its time and resources investigating if you say i saw a bad thing happen what do you think fbi is going to do with that not among democrats several of whom had been unaware of the information until a new york times report this weekend details a new alleged incident involving kavanagh so weird chris coons knew about this why do not all the other democrats if he thought it was such a serious allegation why was not nancy pelosi yelling about it where were all the other democrats yelling about it according to the washington post that inaction made public in recent days through new reports about cavanaugh 's alleged misbehavior has renewed a bitter debate about how his confirmation was handled angering democrats about a process they felt was rushed and enemy animating republicans who decried what they viewed his attempts to assassinate cavanaugh 's character i love that the idea here is that what 's what led to this outrage is a lack of investigation by the fbi not a bunch of fresh non corroborated allegations from the new york times that have been blown so far out of proportion that the new york times would not run this as a news story because they do not feel there was enough jews so in other words the new york times editorial board said this is not news enough for us to run in the news section but the washington post and new york times editorial boards also say the fbi should have expended full resources investigating this nothing bergeron allegation it 's unreal and it 's obviously politically motivated just as the original allegations against cavanaugh were by the democrats not lazy for it i do not know why blasi ford did what,0.3054,so lido continues along these lines he says that there is no basis for viability distinction in roe versus wade he says here 's the court 's entire explanation well with respect to the state 's important and legitimate interest in potential life the compelling point is it viability this is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the womb well as lawrence tribe who 's a lefty who likes roe has written clearly this mistakes a definition for a syllogism the definition of a viable fetus is one that is capable of surviving outside the womb why is this point the point at which the state 's interest becomes compelling if as rojo the state 's interest in protecting prenatal life is compelling after viability why is not that interest equally compelling before viability roe did not say no explanation is apparent this arbitrary line has found no support among philosophers and an ephesus who have attempted to justify right to abortion some have argued a fetus should not be entitled to legal protection until it acquires the characteristics they define they regard as defining what it means to be a person among the characteristics that have been offered as the essential attributes of personhood are sentients self - awareness and the ability to reason or some combo thereof by this logic says alito it 'd be an open question whether even born individuals including young children or those afflicted with certain developmental or medical conditions merit protections as persons but even if one takes the view personhood begins when a certain attribute or combination of attributes is acquired it 's very hard to see why viability marks the point at which personhood begins the viability line makes no sense it is telling that other countries almost uniformly issue such a line the court thus asserted raw judicial power to impose as a matter of constitutional law a uniform viability rule that allowed the state 's less freedom to regulate abortion than the majority of western democracies enjoy by the way this is an interesting point here and a good point for malito america 's abortion law is far more liberal than nearly every european country nearly all of them all in all says alito rose decisioning was rose reasoning was exceedingly weak academic commentators including those who agreed with the decision as a matter of policy were unsparing in their criticism john hard eli famously wrote roe was not constitutional law and gave almost no sense of an obligation to try to be archibald cox who served as solicitor general under kennedy commented that roe reads like a set of hospital rules and regulation that neither historian layman or lawyer will rep will be persuaded are part of the constitution lawrence tribe wrote that even if there is a need to divide pregnancy into several segments with lines that clearly identify the limits of governmental power interest balancing of the form the court pursues fails to justify any of the lines actually drawn martashnot again another lefty terms wrote a totally unreasoned judicial opinion this of course is correct and then as alito points out when casey revisited roe almost 20 years later very little of rose reasoning was even defended or preserved the court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the 14th amendment the court did not reaffirm 's erroneous accounts of abortion history none of the justices in the majority said anything about the history of the abortion right as for precedent the court relied essentially on the same body of cases roe had cited thus with respect to the standard grounds for constitutional decision making text history and precedent casey did not attempt to bolster rose reasoning the court do not even attempt to re - enshrine viability as the standard in planned parenthood versus casey casey also deployed a novel version of the doctrine of starry decisis this this new doctrine did not account for the profound wrongness of the decision in roe and placed great weight on an intangible form of reliance with little if any basis in prior case law sorry decisions does not command the preservation of such a decision and then alito gets to the problem of workability he points out that the standard in planned parenthood versus case is totally unworkable the un so - called underburden standard so planned parenthood versus casey created a standard suggesting that you can not pass a law that creates an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion underburden is a fudge phrase meaning nothing as alito points out problems begin with the very concept of an undue burden as justice scalia noted in his casey descent determining whether a burden is due or undo is inherently standardless the casey plurality tried to put meaning into the underburdened test by sending out three subsidiary rules these rules create their own problems the first rule is that a provision of law is invalid if its purpose or a fact is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability but whether a particular obstacle qualifies as substantial is open to reasonable debate in the sense relevant here substantial means of ample or considerable amount quantity or size huge burdens are plainly substantial trivial ones are not but in between these extremes there 's a wide gray area this ambiguity is a problem and the second rule which applies at all stages of pregnancy muddies things further it states that measure is designed to ensure the woman 's choice is informed are constitutional so long as they do not impose an undue burden on the right,0.8486,but but they are only cutting off some of those banks why not all the banks the reason they are only cutting off some of the banks is because they do not want to cut off russia 's energy sector that continues through non - sanctioned banks according to the wall street journal russia is one of the world 's top oil and natural gas producers energy exports represent half of the country 's foreign sales the country now embroiled in a bitter war in ukraine provides around 40 percent of all of europe 's natural gas about 50 of all of germany 's natural gas the commodity heats the continent fuels many of its power plants is a critical input for a range of industrial processes russia 's crude production is a major factor in the global oil marketplace policymakers are tailoring their pressure campaign to protect their energy supply preventing surge in oil prices and minimize the damage to their own economies justine walker head of sanctions and risk at the associate of certified anti - money laundering specialist said you can not get away from the fact that europe still has a dependency on russia so the the continuing dependence on russian oil means that all of the sanctions that are being undertaken they are damaging the russian economy but they are not the mother of all bombs here a senior biden official said on saturday officials were carefully selecting which russian banks to eject from the swift network to minimize disruption of energy markets the official said we know where most of the energy flows occur through which banks they occur and if we take that approach we can simply choose the institutions where most of the energy flows do not occur and meanwhile the attempt by the united states to split off china from russia is utterly unveiling so all of the economic sanctions that we are placing on russia they are going to be little avail if china continues to funnel money to russia and they have a mutual interest in doing so first of all china gets a lot of oil from russia and so they want to remain on warm terms with russia and second of all russia needs china 's help in the international marketplace because people have not cut off china at the knees as of yet meanwhile china is happy to see russia invade ukraine as a predicate to china invading taiwan there 's a story that came out late last week the biden administration had spent months attempting to get china to split off from russia and in fact had shown them confidential intelligence which china then promptly turned around and handed directly to the russians according to the new york times they visited a hockey rink in beijing and the panda enclosure at the moscow zoo they shared blinis layered with caviar in russia and reciprocally the popular variant in china zhang bing they have shared birthday cakes and exchanged toast with shots of vodka while to mirroring that neither would dare go overboard with the stuff for more than a decade xi jinping of china and vladimir putin of russia have forged a respectful perhaps even warm relationship reflecting the deepening ties between two world powers that share common cause against american military and economic might invasion of ukraine could upend all that or forge in diplomatic isolation an alliance that reshapes the world order in the 21st century xi is sort of in a balancing act right now he does not want to completely cut off the west because he makes a lot of money from the west but he do not do anything to ward off the invasion he do not try to tell putin not to do it china is is waiting in other words china is not likely to tell russia to call it off it 's pretty clear that russia waited until the end of the chinese olympics in order to launch its invasion finally the white house is publicly calling on china to get involved white house press secretary jensaki she said this is not a time to stand on the sidelines it 's time to be vocal and condemn the actions of putin in russia but china is very unlikely to do that at this point beyond some sort of pitter patter so that is that is an unlikely thing to happen so we have to ask ourselves at this point what do we get wrong because it seems like a lot of the foreign policy truisms of the last half century they are just wrong what if it 's possible that the ancient wisdom of foreign policy is still right because human nature does not change but first let us talk about the fact that helix does not just make mattresses we talked about that a moment ago they also make sofas

point gap but that like that is such a that is such a low - level question who do you think is going to win matters significantly less than for whom will you vote vote in this poll kla harris leads donald trump by one point in a head - to - head matchup among registered voters one point the margin of error here is three points which means this is a dead heat it is a dead heat not only that the previous yahoo news ugv pole found harris and trump tied at 46 % a piece which means she got no bounce from the dnc remember the dnc was the most important thing that has ever happened on this planet it was beautifully staged they trotted out barack and michelle obama they came down from on high descended upon the people and brought forth their haloed presences in order to demonstrate just how magical kamai harris was we met the ghost of joe biden at that dnc we brought forth the moldering corpse of bill clinton prostate no longer working and so he is now desica into ruin and of course we saw tim walls with his weird sitcom dad happy goofy communist energy and we saw kamla harris who spoke off a teleprompter and that was supposed to be a magical for the democrats and here is the size of their convention bounce zero does not exist why is not that the news why is not the news that this thing is a dead heat and the answer is the media want you to believe this race is over they want you to believe this race is over the reality is k harris remains unpopular today after some of the most glowing media coverage in the history of media coverage after the completion of the democratic media human centipede kamla harris 's favorability rating is 47 % not 60 % not 70 % 47 % by the way when she entered the race she was at 40 % so a minority of americans like kamala harris and what is her favorability rating among independents 40 % it was 30 now it 's 40 in other words people do not like her very much as far as approval of her performance as vice president 42 % again the these are not incredibly spectacular numbers for the current vice president of the united states democrats are more optimistic because they got rid of the zombie candidate and they put in somebody who is technically alive but their fresh coat of paint on the crappy jalopy is not doing much for the american people again as it turns out this poll shows a dead heat not only that some of the other polling that is favoring kla harris say for example the morning consult poll that morning consult poll has not moved it has not moved since before the dnc and that is after some of the most glowing media coverage ever according to morning console not according to me for the fifth week running voters remain more likely to say they heard something positive than negative about harris by a double digit margin that has never happened for donald trump his entire career meanwhile only 42 % of voters hold favorable views of tim walls and these are not great numbers for the democrats so after weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks of sycophantic media coverage this thing is still a dead heat that is the actual news story and that means that kla harris is in real trouble it 's the reason why she is agonizing it 's why her staff is doing to mutic debate over exactly who should interview her how and where in fact cnn had a panel just the other night in which they were agonizing over does she even have to do an interview,0.4942,society in general asks this question about all kinds of things like our cars worth it our smartphones worth it is the internet worth it all these things they they take up a lot of energy and bitcoin us argue that bitcoin is definitely worth it for this for the sound money aspect alone musk is determining by fiat that it is not well instead of letting the market decide it 's it 's very hard to um decipher uh what what musk meant with his recent comments because uh tesla is still holding uh like a lot of bitcoin on their balance sheet i think it 's about 2 billion us dollars worth in bitcoin and they do not intend to sell any and so um you know like it 's it 's a political game to to um like so let me ask you this if you guys are right just tell me if i am leaping somewhere i should not be here but what should happen is that whatever energy is expended in the production of bitcoin and the maintenance of the system should be more than recoup by the increased efficiency of every system that use bitcoin as a transactional device and so the net energy there will be a net energy gain not a net energy loss if you calculated it across the entire system and so it 's a mistake just to look at the cost of generating bitcoin in the absence of considering the efficiencies that bitcoin would produce and the same is true for for gold as well you know like it takes a lot of energy to extract gold from the ground and historically society in general uh answered this question in the affirmative,0.7015,so it 's a tricky situation but let me explain a multi - channel network has severed ties with a medium to large - sized youtube channel this is a youtube channel with over half a million subscribers they were told by their multi - channel network that because of a new youtube policy they were being forced to remove them from their multi - channel network now i do not want to reveal too many details as i am still awaiting confirmation from youtube as to what 's going on but because of the timing with philip defranco and the response from boogie and a lot of talk about youtube and its problems i thought i should bring this up right now i have independently verified an email where an mcn said that youtube has made changes to its system and flagged certain channels requiring them to remove them from their network an mcn is a multi - channel network these are essentially support systems to help youtubers get access to music better analytics archival footage but also because youtube can deal with the sheer amount of channels mcn sort of popped up to be kind of a middleman but more so help youtube deal with these channels i am with a multi - channel network this gets me music i can get access to archival footage i actually have a couple of different music libraries this is the most important thing you will notice i got a lot of cool music and a lot of my videos and this is what i need a multi - channel network for they do take a small percentage of my income but in exchange i get a whole lot more i have been invited to some high - profile events i have been able to meet some high - profile creators in los angeles and other places because the network sort of brings people together and helps you helps you do work now mc ns do not help everyone often they will sign smaller channels for a bigger percentage and these small channels will get access to music and other add - ons that they might need but will you get a one - on - one conversation with you know an mcn to help you build your channel maybe maybe not it 's really hard to know some multi - channel networks are better than others but i have actually got me invited to an event happening in orlando where i will be speaking on a panel with some other political commentary and korea news creators on youtube so there are a lot of benefits to having an mcm for youtube to enact a policy where they said these users can no longer be in an mcn that 's actually pretty scary because there 's also some add benefits certain types of advertisements can only be accessed if you have an mcm certain channel perks can only be accessed if you have an mcm and now it was seen based on emails that i have personally reviewed that some creators at least one has been removed and the explanation is that youtube has a new policy and flagged them for removal they will now have to handle their monetization entirely on their own if you have made it this far here 's what i need to say you need to follow me on twitter at tim cast because i will post my live streams there i will post videos on twitter if i have to and twitter is the second most used platform by me i post everyday to youtube i do not post a twitter every day twitter 's more for conversation and youtube is for my actual work but also go to minds.com ford / tim cast that is mi n.d s.com / tim cast because if i have to i will shift all of my work there in the event that youtube does suppress my channel or there is a an all - out collapse seeing big traders like boogie talk about a plan b it 's particularly scary it 's scary to think that one day i might come to my channel and my views are suppressed and i have been flagged by youtube 's the user that i am referring to who was removed by their multi - channel network has seen their views rapidly decline and it has also confirmed that their videos are not showing up in search for whatever reason it is entirely possible this is all coincidental it is entirely possible that the person working for this mcn was wrong and is misleading this person because they just want to sever ties,0.1786,"and you have done the responsible thing for your family and for yourself so if you are one of many people looking to buy life

krugman what the perspective of a latte czar who is the us secretary of health and human services and he points out the sacrifices americans have made through social distancing have helped slow down the spread of the virus and save lives moving forward we need to confront the misconception that going back to normal life just means balancing the health risks of reopening against the economic cost of aggressive social distancing returning to normal is not about balancing health versus the economy it 's about balancing health versus health the health risks of cova 19 balance against the health social and economic costs of keeping main streets across the united states closed for business getting this ballot balance right is not simple it will look different for every state business and family the trump administration is committed to helping each state and all americans have the information and tools they need to safely reopen and he is correct about this again this is obviously a more nuanced position than you want to reopen it 's because you want grandma to die idiots like paul krugman are going to have to explain why it is then that gavin newsom is reopening why it is then that andrew cuomo is reopening alex azar says the economic process crisis brought on by the virus is a silent killer estimates suggest that each one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate translates into a 1 % increase in suicide deaths and a more than 3 percent increase in opioid deaths which means this virus induced recession will likely cost tens of thousands of excess deaths one study of the 1982 recession found that americans who face higher unemployment suffered approximately 40,000 excess deaths by age 65 as well as more divorces in having fewer children shortening this economic crisis through a safe reopening could save thousands of lives meanwhile at a time of social stress states are seeing a decline in reports of child maltreatment which is likely going unreported because children are isolated from teachers and others who keep an eye on the vulnerable the cova 19 response is also restricted access to health care data suggests the number of americans receiving important preventative services are down significantly mammograms are down 87 % colonoscopies are down 90 % more than 1.7 million new cancer cases are diagnosed per year in the united states if we see an 80 percent drop in cancer cases identified approximately we could already have 200,000 or more undiagnosed cancer cases as a result breast cancer surgeries are down approximately two - thirds since january vaccine administrations were down 60 % from early january to mid march which means you could see a measles outbreak in the fall right all of this stuff is really really bad and you have to balance all of this these are these are needs you have to balance their reports from california there are california doctors who are now saying that in their areas they are seeing more deaths by suicide than they are from kovat 19 dr . michael de bois blanc of john muir medical center in walnut creek california said that the numbers are unprecedented he said he 's seen as a year worth of suicides in the last four weeks alone he says i think this was originally put in place to flatten the curve and make sure hospitals have the resources to take care of kovach patients we have resources you that our other community health is suffering again i talked to people in the medical industry literally every day they are sitting at their desks doing nothing because people are not coming into the hospitals for the care that they need because they were told that they were not supposed to come and stay home if you can well now it turns out that hospitals are firing people in the middle of a pandemic it 's incredible meanwhile it turns out that over in washington state a fraud network siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars off of the unemployment funds so you can do this for a little while you can do the pour money into the into the hose for a little while but pretty quickly it turns into a fraud program prickly pretty quickly it becomes obvious how much money is being wasted and pretty quickly it becomes obvious that government is not a substitute for having a job and trusting your neighbors to be responsible citizens officials confirm this fraud on the same day the federal government reported another 2.4 million american workers filing for jobless benefits this week the total is a staggering thirty eight point six million people have filed for jobless benefits in the last nine weeks alone which is totally insane unprecedented in american history the labor department has found that a large majority of laid - off workers according to the new york times expect their joblessness to be temporary but there 's growing concern among economists that many jobs will never come back nicholas blum economist at stanford he said i hate to say it this is going to take longer and look grimmer than we thought this is why it 's actually important to reopen the economy as fast as possible one of the reasons it 's really important to do that as fast as possible is specifically because you need to let the market iron out all of the inefficiencies in the market as we move into a new world we are going to have to figure out exactly how restaurants cope by restaurants for example are going to the market does help create a feedback loop of what is needed so right now commercial real estate is getting devastated obviously because why would you rent commercial real estate when you can not go into the office but let us say that you are a restaurant you might actually need more commercial real estate one of the reasons you might need more commercial real estate is you knock down the wall between your little store fronts and the storefront next to you and suddenly you can actually fit number of people you need to fit in there with the social distancing in other words getting back to the real world and letting people make decisions about their own economic livelihood is going to be necessary in order to see an uptick in the economy centralized government bureaucracy and pouring money into the economy at the same time they are telling companies whether they can and can not open is a recipe for disaster more and more americans are realizing this and that 's a good thing i mean i think that that that is good it means that americans are zealous about their freedoms they should be zealous about their freedoms it 's a very very important thing by the way this is president trump 's pitch so president trump was in michigan yesterday and he said listen americans want to go back to work he is correct about this by the polling data were about evenly split but among the americans who have a job and just lost one majority do you want to go back to work and that 's going to increase over time it 's not going to decrease over time the momentum for reopening is obvious it is clear we are moving toward reopening and that 's a good thing here as president trump yesterday at the ford factory in michigan there 's a tremendous pent up demand and that occlusive cars americans who need and want to return to work should not be vilified they should be supported unlike many politicians and journalists for those who are a living with their own two hands working remotely is just not an option you do not have the option of doing that",0.5255,matt good morning every child deserves to be kept safe from harmful drugs and surgeries and no one i repeat no one has a right to harm children and that 's why alliance defending freedom has been working with lawmakers policy organizations medical professionals and countless others to protect children from dangerous life altering and unnecessary gender transition drugs and surgeries and to help defend these critical laws in court children who experience discomfort with their biological sex deserve to be treated with dignity and respect and they need access to compassionate effective mental health care that is rooted in biological truth but activist and profit gender driven clinics like the one at vanderbilt university that bragged about gender transition procedures being quote huge money makers they have deceived children and parents alike into believing that unnatural life altering and even permanently sterilizing puberty blockers hormones and surgeries are the solution to these children struggle these clinics use hormones to delay puberty and to transition children that trps these vulnerable children into dysphoria that they would naturally desist from if we just let them experience normal and healthy purity instead of damaging their bodies indeed the american psychological association admits that the overwhelming majority of children will naturally resolve their dysphoria as they mature simply put the medical establishment is failing these children prioritizing profits and ideology over science - based care for kids and that failure is being compounded by our own federal government working in conjunction with gender ideology activists to push this dangerous ideology over the health and well - being of children rather than supporting tennessee and the 25 other states that have passed these laws protecting kids from medical transition the biden harris administration is advocating for these laws to be struck down right now here at the high court remember this is the same administration that secretly pushed groups like w path to lower the suggested age limits for these dangerous drugs and surgeries for children and it did so at a time when many other countries around the world are correcting course those countries have seen firsthand the irreversible damage that this medical transition does to children experiencing gender dysphoria in fact the nations that spearheaded transitioning children are now changing their policies because there is no reliable scientific evidence that demonstrates that these harmful procedures improve health that 's why sweden england finland and others which what recommended these procedures are prohibiting them and protecting children from their devastating effects rather than repeat the mistakes of europe tennessee and the 25 other states chose to learn from their mistakes they chose to do better for kids in tennessee and across this country protecting them from life - altering tragedy our laws have long protected kids from things that society has determined are harmful to them or that children lack the maturity and exper experience to handle if a kid can not sign a contract vote purchase alcohol tobacco or even get a tattoo how can a child be mature enough to consent to these experimental irreversible medical procedures that can lead to permanent sterilization tennessee 's law rightly protects children 's natural biological development ensuring that these kids experiencing dysphoria have a chance for comprehensive healing and counseling instead of dangerous life - altering drug drugs and surgeries laws like tennesses reject the politicized and harmful practice of pushing kids towards drugs and surgeries that have irreversible harms children deserve healthc care rooted in science and biology they deserve to know the truth about their bodies and to give them the time to grow into comfort with their bodies in their true ide uh biologically based identities these harmful life - altering drugs are never the solution to an uh never the answer for kids that experience discomfort with their sex what 's happened to people like prisha mosley to people like chloee cold and others that you are going to be hearing from today that has got to be stopped and it 's a preventable tragedy tennessee 's law ensures that no more children suffer from health care providers putting ideologically over healthare lies over truth or political agendas over science thank you,0.5483,she 's head of the the teachers union i do not think she 's really going to be pushing for that she will be pushing for getting rid of guns leaving the schools more exposed and the simple truth that we all know we all know is that if you take away guns first off there are probably 400 million guns something like that what 's the number i think it 's around 350 million if i am not mistaken guns in the united states right now and it 's an estimate because they do not fully know but there basically are as many guns as people something like that in the united states right now um if you say okay we are going to take away 100 million guns and we are going to make it harder for 18 year olds to get guns etc etc what will happen is that bad guys will be the only people to have guns there are 393.3 million guns in the united states right now there are an awful lot of new gun owners in the united states over the last two years ourselves included because we realized especially living in los angeles we could not depend on the defunded police and the ridiculous district attorneys to defend us as riots literally went by our house so the point is that you could take away guns from people and who will give up guns who who will do a buyback now they always say a buyback on guns except a buyback would be if the same person who sold you the gun bought it back this is a buyback when the government is going to give you money for it does not really buy back that i do not think that 's the technical term on that one but the simple truth is the more that you say okay we will get some of these guns off the streets good people will give up their guns good guys who have decided to defend themselves will give up their guns the bad guys will still have the guns this is a point there 's a clip going around uh twitter right now that 's going viral that joe rogan has been making for quite some time i wrote this thing once that said this country has a mental health problem disguised as a gun problem and that 's what it is,0.5731
but but even on the misinformation you know point that you mentioned this really all came to to fruition by the rolling stone article um that had came out on me uh you know being an anti - bachelor in anti - science and that was my first you know kind of welcoming to misinformation you know when i decided to do the decided to do the article i was like you know what here 's this rolling stone article this guy he seems you know to be in good faith wanting to get my perspective on the vaccine um that i had the same as that i had during the press conference and to see myself be completely like just completely misrepresented in every fashion um that was the eye opener for me like man this is bigger than a vaccine it 's bigger you would think that you know everyone who is saying you know this is so important and people are losing lives you would want to you know correctly articularly articulate the position of you know somebody you know of my stature in the nba um and calvaries and other people but that that was not the case and so um you know if someone is going to say there 's misinformation on one side i think there can be a great case for misinformation on the other that 's interesting actually so you went into that rolling stones article with the intention of just kind of having a conversation about it and came out on the other side you know with the information that had come out of that article completely different than the way you wanted it actually viewed exactly 100 and uh you know,0.1113,it 's not just the big tech social media platforms that foster hatred and encourage violence against conservatives and trump supporters or the operation mockingbird assets on cnn and msnbc like joy reid and her merry band of misfits who whip their viewers into a frenzy that have probably incited numerous hate crimes against trump supporters over the past seven years hollywood also has major hand in demonizing us through their endless propaganda disguised as entertainment with plot lines that would have caused a national outrage not too long ago in the past but now are just accepted as the status quo in the new world order the cbs legal drama the good fight posted a trailer on their official twitter account showing one of the main characters ranting about how there 's free speech in america and called for openly attacking american citizens unprovoked he said who engage in speech that social justice warriors perceive as supposedly racist which of course means pretty much everything these days to the left supporting the border wall is considered to be racist celebrating the fourth of july white people existing and so all trump supporters are nazis and they want all of us to be silenced jailed or dead the good fight clip also referred to then alt - right leader richard spencer getting sucker punched while giving an interview in washington d.c and insinuated that anyone wearing a maga hat in public should face the same fate amazon produced a show for their prime streaming service titled hunters which is about a diverse group of vigilantees led by al pacino who go around assassinating people who they think are secret nazis working in the united states to revive the third reich in one of the trailers posted online a supposed nazi could be seen wearing a red baseball cap with some white writing on it looking almost identical to a make america great again hat which of course was by design the series probably incited several vigilantes to attack supposed nazis may remaining ordinary trump supporters and since the left thinks that free speech is hate speech and hate speech is violence they justify physically attacking conservatives unprovoked because antifa idiots believe that they are fighting actual nazis the executive producer of hunters is jordan peele the black director behind get out who has an ax to grind with white people so it 's not surprising that he would be involved with a series that fetishizes torturing and killing them the left always accuse others of exactly what they themselves are guilty of it 's a form of psychological projection as well as a gaslighting technique they are so detached from reality that they lack the ability for introspection and they can not really see that they are the violent ones while claiming that it 's donald trump and his supporters they are acting like fascists accusing trump of being one they are the racists spewing hatred of white people every day while claiming white people are inspiring to uphold the systemic white supremacist system in the united states simply because we exist law and order svu aired an episode about a character based on an amalgamation of ann coulter and millie weaver who used to work for infowars and in the show the character was sexually assaulted by a suspected antifa member but because of her political views some of the police investigating the attack wrestled with sympathizing with her and the episode was titled infowar so there 's no doubt what the producer 's intent was for making the episode at the end the final twist was the attacker might not have been antifa after all but one of the woman 's own supporters depicted as a vile white supremacist because he got upset with her after she had turned down his advances the night before when they met at a bar the moral of the story was that antifa are just peaceful protesters fighting against right - wing extremists and while the victim was worried about them thinking that they were responsible for her assault it was one of her own supporters the conservatives who are the violent ones the law and order svu series usually depicts white men as the criminals often rapists and avoids story lines about illegal aliens being the perpetrators or latino gangs involved in sex trafficking even though the shows supposedly often inspired by actual events and the producers are extra careful not to include very many black people as perpetrators out of concerns of supposedly perpetuating stereotypes about black men and crime actress jessica chastain once posted a link on twitter to a time magazine article denouncing antifa the left 's terrorist foot soldiers but they later posted a video tearfully apologizing after a barrage of social justice warriors and marxists saying that she was helping nazis by denouncing the increasing violence being waged against trump supporters she literally cried and apologized for denouncing violence a against trump supporters while everyone is familiar with trump derangement syndrome the irrational hatred and fear of donald trump during his presidency for the first time in modern history the chorus of hollywood celebrities crossed the line far beyond their usual criticism and hatred of the republican president into openly calling for him to be assassinated madonna famously said that she wanted to blow up the white house self - proclaimed comedian kathy griffin did that infamous photo shoot where she held up a decapitated bloody head of donald trump which looked like an isis beheading she also wanted to beat down donald trump 's then 11 year old son baron at one of their shows in mexico guns and roses brought a donald trump pinata on stage and invited their fans to beat on it at a green day concert in oakland california singer billy joe armstrong shouted well i probably should not repeat it otherwise youtube would probably take this video down because their voice recognition system will flag it and they will think that i was making those claims but he opened only called for donald trump to be assassinated rapper snoop dogg shot to figure dressed as president trump in one of his music videos marilyn manson beheaded him with a large knife in one of his rapper big sean did a freestyle about murdering donald trump with an ice pick and a popular hip - hop radio show all with no consequences with the exception of some blowback against kathy griffin with cnn dropping her as anderson cooper 's sidekick for their new year 's eve coverage actor adam pally who starred in a time traveling comedy series called making history told tmz that if time travel were possible he would go back and assassinate donald trump johnny depp went even further saying that someone should do it right now remember that it made headlines but he faced no consequences whatsoever he was not dropped by his management company none of his movies were pulled from the streaming services nothing when cabal harris was running for president in 2020 before dropping out because her campaign ran out of money and she knew she had no chances of actually winning she joked with ellen degeneres about killing trump robert demerio has said numerous times that he wanted to assault him jim carrey said that he had a dream where he murdered him with a golf club mickey rourke said that he wanted to attack him with a baseball bat after the iranian government put out an 80 million bounty on president trump 's head comedian george lopez responded on instagram saying he would do it for half that while hosting saturday night live comedian john mulaney urged people to assassinate president trump like julius caesar the list goes on and on the atmosphere the liberal media created in the trump era where publicly wishing for his death became commonplace incited numerous unhinged lunatics to attempt to storm the white house break into trump 's mar - a - lago resort in florida yet with the exception of kathy griffin getting dropped by cnn as co - host of their new year 's eve coverage none of the celebrities calling for his assassination have faced any consequences not legally or professionally none but if a conservative makes a joke that hurts black people 's feelings or any gender non - binary people or members of the lgbt whatever community then they are targeted for cancelation immediately hollywood is not only filled with degenerate hypocrites who hate everything that is normally good and spend their time trying to poison our culture and undermine the very foundation of our constitutional republic but let us be honest here at their very core they simply really are servants of

amazon.com or click the link in the description below and check them out,0.3849,no of course not that 's extremely hyperbolic however i do think it 's fair to say that they are elements of the left that are absolutely evil at least to my standard this means they are narcissistic egotistical they think they are better than everyone and they want to wield power against others they are the authoritarian regressive left now i bring this up because yesterday marcus pearson the famous game developer who made minecraft said on twitter if you are still on the left please wake up you are evil he was referencing an incident where a game developer lost a lifetime achievement award because activists made up false accusations against him to trigger a me - too moment in gaming he later went to clarify that it was a small contingent of people on the left that are really dominating the conversation and i think that 's true now whether or not you want to define this behavior the regressive behavior of social justice activists were kind of shutting down speech whether or not you want to say that 's evil is entirely up to you but we do have a study that just came out showing narcissists do not like diversity of opinion and white liberals tend to be racist so today let us take a look at some of these studies but i also want to go through the ramifications of this narcissistic elitism and what happens when people think they are better than you and how it affects politics in real life but before we get started please head over to patreon.com forward slash tim cast if you want to support my work patrons of the backbone of the content i create i know many of you are asking for more on - the - ground reporting it is coming i am building a mobile studio and i will have a slew of actual field reporting and on - the - ground conversations on my channel sub verse as soon as that project is done so if you want to help me out patreon.com slash tim cast i want to start by taking a look at these tweets from knotch because it kind of highlights where we are going with the conversation he said reminder that the creator of atari missed out on a lifetime achievement award because sexist dick faces made - up proven lies about him because gaming have not had it 's me to moment yet if you are still on the left please wake up you are evil he tweeted shortly after we are where we are because the tiny insane loudmouths usurped the left and use shame to keep people in line and the left where unity is very valued has their strengths used against themselves and is now fully evil people going along with for the principle of it are unfortunately evil well - meaning but evil there are a lot of people that are much more passionate about this than i am certainly i am no stranger to criticize on the left because i do it substantially more than i criticize the right and the reason for that as i have explained in the past is that i am on the left and i feel like these people are causing me problems how am i supposed to push my values when authoritarian narcissistic egotistical chur but a study was recently published by kent university showing that narcissists do not like democracy or diversity of opinion and i wonder if there was a correlation there and i think there is a correlation between narcissism and the regressive left from yurika alert narcissists less likely to support democracy new research suggests that people with a narcissistic self you are more likely to demonstrate lower support for democracy they are also more likely to feel that democracies are not good in maintaining order or that it would be better if countries were run by strong leaders or the military the research which was co led by psychologist at the university of kent suggests this is probably because narcissists tend to feel entitled and superior to others which results in lower tolerance of diverse political opinions in contrast people who take a positive non defensive self view and trust others are more likely to show support for democracy the research found the study could actually go in either direction the far right which is associated with strong traditionalism and the far left which is associated with the regressive left and communism and those things although left and right are typically ill - defined i think you understand what i am trying to say it 's often very complicated the point is people who are narcissistic tend not to like democracy they do not like diverse political opinions so right now for those of us that are focused on the regressive left we can see that perhaps the reason they do not support diverse opinions is because they are extremely narcissistic and they believe they are better than you this is actually i think this is fairly obvious to most people that this is the case especially among mainstream democrats what did n ik esperen of the young turks say i think so poorly of them and the reason why is because look i do not think that you are a single - issue voter i just think you are dumb,0.1731,is that the riots resulted in demoralization and police just do not want to be involved anymore they are going to mention the massive increase in homicides which for the most part we have covered and we know about they also mentioned they led a councilman who was nearly killed by carjackers cuomo 's at the crime wave threatened to derail the city 's recovery from the pandemic noting everything we just talked about with the economy coming back you know what the first step is people have to feel safe in a swipe at his political nemesis de blasio the governor said that defunding the police was not the correct solution until you restore the trust and make the reforms necessary we are going to have this problem defund the police is not the answer it basically means abolish the police now this is the important point while we can go back and forth on covet versus defunding the police even some democrats say defunding the police led to this escalation that 's the best i can say i suppose that 's going to help gun violence is going up all crimes going up and that 's going to help no it 's reform so that the community says i now trust the relationship i am a lifelong new yorker i have seen this cycle over and over and over again i remember getting on a subway train and making sure there was no jewelry making sure you were not wearing a chain he said that was real the tension between the state and local leaders also played out this week in texas where the state legislature is pushing a bill that would severely punish cities that defund their police departments aimed primarily at city leaders in austin the liberal dominated state capital h.b 1900 passed the texas senate on monday over the objections of democrats the bill would allow vast tracts of austin that have been annexed since the 1990s to vote to secede from the city unless police funding is restored the secession votes could severely hurt austin 's budget if they passed decimating the city 's tax base the bill would bar austin from re - annexing the areas for 10 years and only if police funding is restored to prior levels texas governor grab abbott a republican has vowed to sign the bill into law it comes as data continues to show a disturbing national increase in violent crime with one study showing an increase of 1 200 murders last year compared to 2019 quote homicide rates were higher during every month of 2020 relative to rates from the previous year states are report from the national commission of covet 19 and criminal justice that said rates increased significantly in june well after the pandemic began coinciding with the death of george floyd and the mass protests that followed so we saw police constrained demoralized attacked demonized one thing that happened was that because police were dealing with the violent riots they could not respond to other crimes and we are also seeing that the crime is dramatically increasing in minority neighborhoods the murder specifically that 's being reported by the wall street journal which suggests it 's black lives matter it 's the activists it 's happening in specific neighborhoods and it 's happening because police resources are constrained if it was coveted that was causing the majority of this you 'd see a uniform increase in crime we do not we see it predominantly in minority neighborhoods which means in the suburbs where wall street journal also reported you i am sorry this is axios that police are making more arrests the cities that defunded their police it is negatively impacting minority neighborhoods ocasio - corset cortez said she wanted policing to look more like the suburbs that would mean more arrests aoc instead you are defunding the police and instead it is the minority neighborhoods that are facing the brunt of this they are they are impoverished areas that can not afford their police or are when you defund the police who do you think is first affected the 26 - page study examined crime rates for 10 different offenses including homicide aggravated assault and robbery in 34 american cities ranging in size from norfolk virginia the smallest sample to new york city the largest they are going to show this massive spike monthly motor vehicle theft skyrocketed between may and july and they stayed high that 's crazy homicide rates were 30 higher than in 2019 however property and drug crimes with the exception of motor vehicle theft fell significantly in 2020 a trend some research researchers attribute to either less community willingness to report minor crimes or less proactive policing there 's another thing you need to understand too homicides are the worst one of the worst possible crimes you can commit the police are going to respond to that i mean you have to deal with a body but what if the police do not take a report on certain crimes then it just seems like crimes are going down it 's entirely possible that crimes are substantially higher than we realize but they are not being reported or police are not taking reports and they are well they are not responding if that 's true it means crime is worse than anyone realizes and that means you are going to be walking out of your car and a bunch of kids are going to jump in and steal it and if you do not get real and say they did this they nearly killed me it 's only going to get worse it 's going to keep happening they say they are going to mention the numbers from many of these cities the three largest cities new york la and chicago accounted for fully 40 percent of the additional people killed in 20 2020 .,0.5597,i know now everybody is talking about joe biden and hunter this has been a kind of skeleton in joe biden 's closet nearly his entire political career members of his family using his name in order to make bank so going back to 2008 mainstream media outlets were reporting on joe biden 's family corruption cbs news reported quote a son of democratic vice presidential candidate joe biden was paid an undisclosed amount of money as a consultant by mbna the largest employer in delaware during the years the senator supported legislation that was promoted by the credit card industry and opposed by consumer groups consumer and civil rights groups and unions as well as democratic opponents had argued that the bankruptcy legislation was unfair to low - income working people single moms minorities and the elderly and would remove a safety net for those who have lost their jobs or face mounting medical bills mbna employees poured more than 200 000 into biden senate campaigns over the past two decades making donors working for the credit card company the senator 's largest source of campaign money and of course biden was receiving sweetheart real estate deals from mbna himself michelle malkin reporting for national review in 2010 wrote former senior senator from delaware and current vice

funds to pay for his compound 's lawn needs he secured the new estate with the help of a corporate executive who worked for biden 's top campaigns owner credit card giant mbna in 1996 biden sold his previous mansion to mbna vice chairman john cochran the asking price was 1.2 million cochran forked over the full sum biden then paid 350 grand in cash to real estate developer keith stoltz for a 4.2 acre lakefront lot stilts had paid that same amount five years earlier for the undeveloped property joe biden 's family spent decades cashing in on his name according to the left - wing site the intercept in 2006 beau biden who died of cancer in 2015 was roped into an investment meeting led by james and hunter biden at the firm paradigm global advisors the family was considering acquiring the firm james biden told executives he 'd have no problem bringing in people looking for an in with joe biden who was a us senator at the time james biden told officials according to a political magazine investigation quote we have got people all over the world who want to invest in joe biden james also in the 90s founded a group called lion hall which lobbied for mississippi trial lawyers involved in tobacco litigation according to curtis wilkie 's book the fall of the house of zeus the trial lawyers wanted james biden 's help pushing joe biden on tobacco legislation and of course then there 's hunter who 's run around picking up bags of cash from everybody from mbna to barisma in fact here 's hunter biden admitting the only reason he was even on the barisma board is because his last name is biden if your last name was not biden do you think he would have been asked to be on the board of burisma,0.6129,"the the the eastern border of israel is a sort of weird conglomeration of jordanian border which is a cold piece with the with the kingdom of jordan and the palestinian authority areas which are honeycombed with terrorist supporters hamas islamic jihad and palestinian authority all three terrorist groups palestinian authority literally pays the the families of of terrorists the northern border for israel is in the golan heights bordering syria which is an iranian proxy and on its pure northern border like it straight northern border that is a border with lebanon which is occupied and controlled by byah hezbollah is a terrorist group that is significantly more powerful than kamas like by by leagues of leagues order orders of magnitude they have some 200,000 rockets pointed apparently at the state of israel they they have entrenched themselves on the northern border of israel israel has had to fight wars there before in order to dislodge them from certain areas most famously in 2007 most recently and that ended with israel sort of creating a demilitarized zone but there 's been anti - tank fire that has been been crossing that border there have been people trying to infiltrate terrorists trying to infiltrate from theah areas into israel so israel is deeply afraid that ifah gets into the war it will be now stretched on two separate borders so they may be holding off on a ground incursion into gaza until they feel that that northern border is solidified and iran of course is trying to ratchet up the game by saying that if israel goes into the gaza strip then they might unleash kah or they might instead pour resources into syria which would then be used in a proxy war with israel according to the times of israel iran on monday said time was running out to reach a political solution to the israel gaza conflict warning of the possibility of expanding the scope of war and the conflict to other fronts apparently iranian president ibrahim risi quote warned against the continuation of crimes by the zionist regime and he warned of a possibility of expanding the scope of war and conflict to other fronts he further the the iranian foreign minister further suggested the possibility of a preemptive action against israel in the coming hours as israel as israel prepared the possibility of in an invasion into the gaza strip in order to clean out the terrorists so iran is obviously attempting to ratchet up the threat for its part america is attempting to do some of the things that i talked about at the opening of the show so america has moved aircraft carriers into the region that would be to push kah off the ball to say to them if you try to fire rockets into israel then we will strike you with our jets and then you will be no more because the combined power of america i mean america does not need israel 's help obviously but the combin power of america and israel or israel in a lead position with america and a support position kah does not anymore so do not get involved right this is what joe biden keeps saying he keep saying do not get involved okay also the united states has been rearming israel to this point as israel needs to be rearmed but there is the third point which is will america let israel do what it needs to do in the gaza strip and here is where things are starting to get quite dicey for the biden administration do they have the intestinal fortitude to allow israel to do what it needs to do in the gaza strip while maintaining the isolation of that conflict which is in everybody 's interest by the way it 's in the interest of iran as well well everyone 's interests are aligned here nobody wants this conflict spreading north tobah and iran iran may pretend that it wants that conflict spreading north",1.0903,and she is not going to overreach she 's not going to read her feelings about what the law should be and what the law is she is going to be a reliable voice on behalf of the text of laws again everybody in their original sort of statements likes to sound like samuel alito or justice scalia or clarence thomas and then as we will see for the left none of that means anything thank you i am particularly mindful of of not speaking to policy issues because i am so committed to staying in my lane of the system because i i i am just not willing to speak to issues that are properly in the province of this body she 's going to stay in her lane and now here 's the thing she 's not going to stay in her lane the reason we know she 's not going to stay in her lane is because she is beholden to the far left she is in fact a member of the far left as is indicated by pretty much everything that she has ever done or said in terms of issues where she could stray to the far left anything in her social life where she could straight to the fire left she has any issue or she could stray to the left she has and this became very clear yesterday in in this judicial hearing when senator marshall blackburn of tennessee she asked jackson to define the word woman and the reason she asked for this is because woman is a category in law comes up a lot comes up in the civil rights act for example in title ix of the civil rights act it comes up with regards to domestic violence it comes up all the time what is a woman now this is an incredibly simple question it 's incredibly simple to answer this question on a biological level women produce eggs and men produce small sized gametes right they produce sperm cells that is the difference between men and women in a biological level in terms of chromosomal composition men have x y women have xx there are certain peculiarities in which for example the sry gene which expresses gender is somehow attached to an x - gene sometimes during transmission that can end up with an intersex case or you can have an x y man or the sry gene is not expressed in which you have a person developed secondary female sexual characteristics but they are genetically chromosomally male that is intersex people that is not the same thing that is claimed by the left the left claims that a man who is x y and whose sry gene has completely expressed is still possibly a woman because they complain that male and female anatomy have nothing to do with male and female anything that gender is completely disconnected from sex now when it comes to the law there is no law in u.s history that has been written that says that a man who identifies as a woman is a woman it 's an absurdity on its face it makes no sense nobody in writing the civil rights act of 1965 was thinking that a male who says he is a woman is in fact a female or that a woman who says she is a man is in fact a man this is newfangled garbage that has come up in the last two years in widespread fashion on the left it 's gender theory going back to the 1960s promulgated by a a perverse piece of human dragon named john money whose gender theories ended with the suicidality of of actual children under his care and now it has been vibed wholesale by all of your cultural matters and elites if you say on twitter that a man is a man and a woman is a woman you may be banned the babylon bee was banned from twitter for the great crime of stating that rachel levine who is the deputy under secretary of health and human services and who is a biological man is a man if you say that on twitter they will ban you if you say that leah thomas who still has twig and berries is a man twitter will ban you so all of our cultural elites have embraced this idiotic notion that it is impossible literally impossible to define women you can not do it you can not define women or men but you can then say that katanji brown jackson is incredibly historic because she is a woman kamala harris is incredibly historic because she is a woman but if you ask either of these people to define the word woman they will not do it why because they are beholden to the far left and they understand that if they were to say a woman is biologically as i have described then they would immediately be cast out as lepers by their own colony their own group you people who love them most would immediately suggest that they are bigots in some way they are transphobic because you have to understand that for the left the final destruction of the gender binary the final destruction of the distinctions that are perfectly natural and embedded in biology between men and women if you can destroy that you can destroy the entire fundamental basis of natural law which undergirds all of natural rights and undergirds all of the systemic building of civilization over the course of millennia if everything just becomes arbitrary and all terms just become arbitrary and everything is power which is precisely what the left wants every natural obstacle to utopia for the left must be wiped away and this includes natural normal and factual distinct distinctions between male and female this is a question that goes very deep because you have to wonder when a highly intelligent person like katanji brown jackson is asked what is a woman and she can not answer you have to know she 's lying again i have a an eight - year - old a five - year - old and a two - year - old all of them know the difference between a boy and a girl that kid from kindergarten cop basically gets it right boys heavy penis and rolls have a vagina this is really really not all that difficult i understand for the left this seems to be difficult but it 's not really difficult for them either 100 of americans including trans people understand biological males are males biological females are females they may not like that,0.3466,okay now that has no legal effect as far as i am aware it does not mean there will be lawsuits presumably because they have now filed affidavits suggesting that they were pressured into changing their votes in favor of certifying the election now let us make something clear just because that board of canvassers the the michigan wayne county board of canvassers did not vote to certify an election result does not mean that the state board of canvassers would not certify the election results or that the republican legislature in michigan was then going to turn around and vote in favor of republican electors for president trump there 's still several steps down the road if you wish to actually reverse the results in michigan and again i i will say that you have to have outsized evidence of massive voter fraud in order to make sense of the of the path whereby you reverse a 150 000 vote discrepancy in favor of joe biden right michigan was not a particularly close state joe biden in the current count is up by about 150 000 votes if you have certain precincts where the poll books are off by one or four votes that obviously is not 150 000 votes and simply wiping millions of votes off the playing card does not seem to make a lot of sense in either a moral or legal sense nonetheless uh if these board of canvassers republicans were pressured into changing their vote that is a pretty serious allegation an affidavit signed on wednesday evening two gop members of the four - member wayne county board of canvassers allege they were improperly pressured into certifying the election and accused democrats for nagging on a promise to audit the votes in detroit so originally it was reported that the republicans in exchange for getting a state audit of the voting in detroit had signed on now they are saying well now you guys are not delivering jonathan kinloch a democrat and the board 's vice chairman told the post it 's too late for the pair to reverse course as the certified results have already been sent to the secretary of state in accordance with state rules and then he lashed out at republicans usa today reporter donovan slack tweeted out a screenshot of an affidavit from monica palmer the republican chair of the committee stating that based on allegations she made in the affidavit she wanted to quote rescind my prior vote to certify wayne county elections according to ryan 's veteran over at daily wire palmer disputed the promises she was told she received from one of her democratic canvas board colleagues mediaite reported she claims contrary to what she was told on tuesday michigan 's secretary of state jocelyn benson has not pledged to conduct an audit of the county 's votes to clear up the minor clerical errors found she wrote the wayne county election had serious laws which deserve investigation i continue to ask for information to assist wayne county voters that these elections were conducted fairly and accurately despite repeated requests i have not received the requisite information and believes in additional 10 days of canvas by the state board of canvassers will help provide the information necessary which suggests that she was not going to hold out on certifying the election result forever she just wanted a little bit longer in order to certify the election result also monica palmer and other republicans uh they have been claiming that they were they were abused and berated by various people into changing their vote william hartman is one of the other canvassers he 's the second republican canvasser and he apparently also filed an affidavit it shows that hartman claimed he was berated faced ridicule and was accused of being a racist after initially voting not to certify the election results he said late in the evening i was enticed to agree to certify based on the promise that a full independent audit would take place i would not have agreed to the certification but for the promise of the audit,0.3275,but that 's a very mundane phrase to describe something of soul - shattering significance the discovery that gratification could be delayed was simultaneously the discovery of time and with it causality at least the causal force of voluntary human action long ago in the dim mists of time we began to realize that reality was struck as if it could be bargained with we learned that behaving properly now in the present regulating our impulses considering the plight of others could bring rewards in the future in a time and place that did not yet exist we began to inhibit control and organize our immediate impulses so that we could stop interfering with other people and our future selves doing so was indistinguishable from organizing society the discovery of the causal relationship between our efforts today and the quality of tomorrow motivated the social contract the organization that enables today 's work to be stored reliably mostly in the form of promises from others understanding is often acted out before it can be articulated just as a child acts out what it means to be mother or father before being able to give a spoken account of what those roles mean the act of making a ritual sacrifice to god was an early and sophisticated enactment of the idea of the usefulness of delay there is a long conceptual journey between merely feasting hungrily and learning to set aside some extra meat smoked by the fire for the end of the day or for someone who is not present it takes a long time to learn to keep anything later for yourself or to share it with someone else and those are very much the same thing as in the former case you are sharing with your future self it is much easier and far more likely to selfishly and immediately wolf down everything in sight there are similar long journeys between every leap and sophistication with regards to delay and its conceptualization short - term sharing storing away for the future representation of that storage in the form of records and later in the form of currency and ultimately the saving of money in a bank or other social institution some conceptualizations had to serve as intermediaries or the full range of our practices and ideas surrounding sacrifice and work and their representation could have never emerged our ancestors acted out a drama a fiction they personified the force that governs fate as a spirit that can be bargained with traded with as if it were another human being and the amazing thing is that it worked this was in part because the future is largely composed of other human beings often precisely those who have watched and evaluated and appraised the tiniest details of your past behavior it 's not very far from that to god sitting above on high tracking your every move and writing it down for further reference in a big book here 's a productive symbolic idea the future is a judgmental father that 's a good start but two additional archetypal foundational questions arose because of the discovery of sacrifice of work both have to do with the ultimate extension of the logic of work which is sacrifice now to gain later first question what must be sacrificed small sacrifices may be sufficient to solve small singular problems but it is possible that larger more comprehensive sacrifices might solve an array of large and complex problems all at the same time that 's harder but it might be better adapting to the necessary discipline of medical school will for example fatally interfere with the licensee estoppel core undergraduate party animal giving that up is a sacrifice but a physician can to quote george w really put food on his family that 's a lot of trouble dispensed with over a very long period of time so sacrifices are necessary to improve the future and larger sacrifices can be better second question set of related questions really we have already established the basic principle sacrifice will improve the future but a principle once established has to be fleshed out it 's full extension or significance has to be understood what is implied by the idea that sacrifice will improve the future in the most extreme and final of cases where does that basic principle find its limits we must ask to begin what would be the largest most effective most pleasing of all possible sacrifices and then how good might the best possible future be if the most effective sacrifice could be made the biblical story of cain and abel adam and eve 's sons immediately follows the story of the expulsion from paradise as mentioned previously cain and abel are really the first humans since their parents were made directly by god and not born in the standard manner cain and abel live in history not in eden they must work they must make sacrifices to please god and they do so with altar and proper ritual but things get complicated abel 's offerings please god but cain 's do not abel is rewarded many times over but cain is not it 's not precisely clear why although the text strongly hints that cain 's heart is just not in it maybe the quality of what came put forward was low maybe his spirit was begrudging or maybe god was vexed for some secret reasons of his own and all of this is realistic including the texts vagueness of explanation not all sacrifices are of equal quality furthermore it often appears that sacrifices of apparently high quality are not rewarded with a better future and it 's not clear why why is not god happy what would have to change to make him so those are difficult questions and everyone asks them all the time even if they do not notice asking such questions is indistinguishable from thinking the realization that pleasure could be usefully for stalled dawned on us with great difficulty it runs absolutely contrary to our ancient fundamental animal instincts which demand immediate satisfaction particularly under conditions of deprivation which are both inevitable and commonplace and to complicate the matter such delay only becomes useful when civilization has stabilized itself enough to guarantee the existence of the delayed reward in the future if everything you save will be destroyed or worse stolen there 's no point in saving it is for this reason that a wolf will down 20 pounds of raw meat in a single meal he is not thinking man i hate it when i binge i should save some of this for next week,0.238,oh god so you need to find the definition for god here is it the trinity or is it god the father let us just use the trinity in the beginning was the word the word was with the trinity so that means the three people and in the word so that 's for if you do simple thought processes in man the word was with the triune god and the word was the triune god that right there and let us go back to say let us use the word jesus for the word word in the beginning was jesus jesus with jesus was with the triune god because when you say god these three are inseparable right this is god you can not separate this this these three are god so jesus was with these three that makes four if you if you just use your basic terminology of the word god jesus was with these three and jesus was these three that that 's that makes no sense because how can jesus be the entire trinity it can not be because the trinity says that the father is not the son the son is not the spirit experience not the prime of the father 's not the son you go in circles so that is a inaccurate depiction of god if we use your terminology of what the word god means so then there are people who say god is the father so let us read it in the beginning was jesus jesus was with the father,0.4378,no i am sorry man bernie sanders absolutely can not muster this now over at newsweek they say this why bernie sanders lost to michigan to joe biden despite winning the state in 2016 and there 's some interesting information here they say sanders eked at a narrow victory in michigan against hillary clinton in 2016 so why did he fail to secure the same outcome in the mitten state this year the answer can be found in the exit polls they showed that younger voters failed to flock to the polls in the same way that the sanders campaign hoped for in fact younger voters accounted for less of the turnout than it did in 2016 his performance among younger voters was overshadowed by that of biden 's ability to win over older voters who accounted for a larger slice of the overall electorate sanders also received less support from white and male voters of this time around amazing white male voters gave bernie less support this time you want to know why that is you want to know my opinion is on why people i know do not like bernie anymore early on in 2016 bernie seemed to be a rational guy then he said on the debate stage if you are white you do not know what it 's like to be poor and he lost a lot of people since then bernie has surrounded himself by these fringe woek identitarian leftists i will not name them but there 's many who are acting as surrogates for fur for bernie sanders what do you think a white male will will feel or do when they see these people around bernie saying these things they are going to back i am out you insult me i am out i do not like that i think you have got crazy beliefs i am out so i am not surprised in the least bit to see that bernie received less support from white male voters they say the dismal showing from younger voters his despite claims by sanders that he has the ability to draw young new voters to the polls after a similar showing on super tuesday this week surrogates for the self - described democratic socialist on capitol hill told newsweek that he needs to broaden his support among the and energized his base to turn out if he hoped to remain a viable candidate and fortunately bernie sanders needs votes he 's not getting joe biden is dominating now it 's fair to say bernie sanders has absolutely dominated in the younger generation votes here 's the thing though you are congratulating yourself about winning over a down a demographic that does not actually vote it 's like opening a business and cheering that every your business is in every seat in your coffee shop is full but it 's people who do not buy anything is read books like dude you are not going to win that way your business can not survive that way now this is silly but i am going to show it anyway already this dude clyburn is calling for the democrats to shut the primary down cancel the debates and just give it to joe biden,0.5951,democrats who called for the firing of fbi director james comey are shocked and appalled by the firing of fbi director james comey the democrats say that comey 's firing will undermine the investigations for which he should have been fired in order to examine which democrat claims are cynical political fabrications and which are hysterical conspiracy theories and which are cynical political hysterical theories about fabricated conspiracies let us examine which investigations might be affected the fbi as we know is investigating whether the trump campaign colluded with the russians to expose the democrats emails the senate meanwhile is investigating whether the obama administration investigated the trump campaign for the collusion that the fbi is investigating the judiciary committee is investigating why the attorney general failed to investigate hillary clinton 's attempt to avoid the fbi investigation into the attorney general 's failure to investigate her emails to the democrats which the russians hacked in an attempt to interfere with our election which the senate is investigating in an attempt to find out if the trump campaign colluded with the russians hack of the democrats emails which the fbi is investigating to see whether the obama administration was investigating the trump campaign the house intelligence committee is investigating whether the house intelligence committee overstepped its bounds in investigating the obama administration 's attempts to use the intelligence community to investigate the trump campaign 's collusion with the russian hack into the democrats emails which the fbi is investigating in order to find out whether the house intelligence committee overstepped its bounds in investigating the obama administration the head of the house committee meanwhile has stepped down pending an investigation at the same time many in the press are investigating why the press never investigated the obama administration 's investigation of the trump campaign but continues to investigate the trump administration 's investigation into whether the obama administration investigated the trump campaign which is now under investigation in the senate causing several investigators to call for an independent investigation into the house investigation of the senate investigation of the trump administration which is meanwhile investigating the obama administration which was on a yacht in the bahamas at the time dancing to the musical stylings of drake 's hotline bling mr drake is not currently under investigation now to be clear an independent investigation into the senate investigation of the house investigation of the obama investigation into the trump campaign could expand the investigation into an investigation of russia 's investigation of the emails that were under investigation by the fbi which was in turn under investigation by the nsa who have been investigating everybody in a surveillance program that 's still under investigation if that were to happen there would no doubt be calls for a full investigation into all the other investigations so it 's easy to see that the firing of james comey will have to be investigated to ensure it does not in any way curtail the important business of government which is investigating just thank god the government 's not actually governing then we 'd all be in real trouble trigger warning i am andrew claven and this is the andrew claven show,0.3049,"[ music ] [ music ] the march for life tens of thousands of people right now are marching on washington dc for the 45th annual march for life never heard of it you are not alone even many conservatives do not really know anything about it because the mainstream media generally black the event out which is really incredible by the way as the march for life is the longest continual protest in american history they have been marching ever since the supreme court 's decision in roe v wade that made up a constitutional right to abortion you know you know that thing with the framers were so concerned about abortion giveme abortion or give me death i forget exactly which article that right to abortion is in but if you read the constitution very very closely and then you invent that right out of whole cloth you should find it pro - life supporters have come in from all over the country and their efforts have not been in vain five years ago in 2013 the number of annual abortions fell below 1 million for the first time in 40 years and that number has slowly continued to drop of course that means there are still roughly 1 million babies killed in the womb each year with maniacal ghouls like cecile richards of planned parenthood snuffing out a third of them planned parenthood alone has killed more than 7 million babies in the womb since roe v-- wade and as the center for medical progress expose showed us planned parenthood has profited marvelously by selling babies body parts on the black market to the highest bidder since roe v-- wade well over 60 million abortions have occurred in the united states to put that in perspective that 's the total population

women would die year from back - alley abortions from coathanger abortions the former head of the national abortion rights action league bernard nathanson has since admitted that he and his pro - abortion conspirators completely invented that number it was totally made up it 's a total lie in reality by 1972 the year before a roe v-- wade when abortion was still illegal in the majority of the country the actual number of women who died from illegal abortions was thirty - nine not thirty - nine thousand not 3939 the wilder statistic is that that same year 24 women died from legal abortions

people are eating dogs in the streets because they nationalize the oil industry and then inflated the currency and destroyed the economy and have refused to hold a decent election the united states since 2019 by the way has not recognized nicholas maduro as the leader of venezuela they have recognized juan guido who is the opposition leader over there as the legitimate leader of venezuela now we are going to go back to maduro and we are going to give him money for his oil so that he can then funnel that to places like cuba to continue the repression it 's going to be great guys this is sorry again remember russia what made russian invasions of foreign countries are powered by western expenditures on russian oil and natural gas so our plan is to substitute for russian oil and natural gas with venezuelan oil and natural gas my god if north korea had oil and natural gas maybe we should maybe go to them are there any other horrible regimes we could go to instead of just drilling instead of just letting fracking leases happen instead of just opening pipelines is absurd it 's by the way it 's it 's even more absurd given the fact that venezuela 's output is fractional venezuela destroyed its own oil industry venezuela is one of the most oil rich places on planet earth they do not produce it anymore because they suck so much at it according to the wall street journal even as the us considers lifting sanctions so venezuela gets oil flowing the reality is that the country 's oil sector is ill - prepared to start churning out more crude and lower fast rising oil prices amid the ukraine war years of mismanagement corruption and nationalization of oil ventures caused venezuela 's oil industry which in the 1990s produced a 3.2 million barrels a day to crash by 2020 when output fell to just one tenth of what it had been production has now more than doubled to about 800 000 barrels a day that is less than one percent of the 100 million barrels dozens of countries produce worldwide daily people who work in or are familiar with the oil industry in venezuela describe a sector that is a shadow of what it once was when the country was one of the four main exporters loyal to the united states rusted and frequently damaged oil pipelines carry a fraction of the crew they once could rigs that once started the landscape in the country 's oil rich sectors have gone quiet looters break into oil installations to steal everything from pumps to compressors to fencing and metal to be sold as scrap the country 's mammoth but decrepit refineries the more active than they were two years ago still process a minimal proportion of the crew they were fined in the 1990s the amoy refinery processed about 168 000 barrels of crew daily in 2021 that is down from 570 000 barrels a day in 1998 and venezuela was never able to replace the thousands of highly trained oil engineers executives and workers who were purged from the state oil company the pdvsa or fled into exile as the regime grew increasingly authoritarian venezuela 's oil industries and intensive therapies therapy said ivan frites the exile general secretary of the oil workers union in venezuela 's falcon state which includes amoy in venezuela you have to build from scratch what has been destroyed so the again the plan of this administration is do not open up the oil leases do not up keys do not open up keystone xl do not ramp up production again the way you would in a war do not do any of those things instead go to one of the world 's worst authoritarian dictatorship and ask them if you could borrow their rusting oil infrastructure and if they could possibly ramp up production so we can fund them by the way venezuela is allied with russia venezuela has been openly allied with vladimir putin for years putin uses venezuela as a base of operations in south america this is insanity age of juan guido the leader of the venezuelan opposition were informed of the meeting at the last minute a high - ranking member of white house team told the miami herald it 's foolish to think maduro will quit russia when a great deal of the corruption funds have been deposited in russia and when russia furthermore is its greatest ally this is a mistake to buy oil to buy oil from enduro is the same as buying oil from putin it 's unreal and and just to make things absolutely clear we are also now making overtures to iran of course so the the biden administration which is supposedly at economic war with russia is currently negotiating using russia with iran presumably to bring iran into the world economy now bring around to the world economy is designed to achieve what it 's not going to moderate the regime what is it designed to achieve it 's designed to bring more oil online more natural gas online because iran is an oil and gas rich region so jensaki is forced into the bizarre position of saying that while we are sanctioning russia and punishing russia and at economic war with russia and shipping military material into ukraine to fight russia it 's no biggie that we are using russia to negotiate with the iranians here 's jensaki yesterday i do not think anyone believes it 's in their interest for iran to acquire a nuclear weapon and that is how we are approaching these negotiations and discussions and certainly as the secretary of state said just yesterday we do not believe that the the sanctions on them have anything to do with that uh shared goal it 's just incredible it 's just incredible so again we decided that we were so ensconced in the green way of thinking and using our imagination like kamala here 's our imagination we decided we were going to do that the problem with imagination is someone 's got to put the bills and it turns out that the way that the west has been footing the bills particularly in europe has been russian oil and natural gas in the united states right now when hit with high oil prices we have decided that our solution is to go to more of the world 's worst people and to ask them for their help and you meanwhile will be paying for our transition to green energy that is not nearly as effective or ready for prime time as the left claims that it is,0.6404,"so what you have here is a disaffected constituency the democratic party is honing in on like a laser beam and they are doing this with kay harris 's presidential aspirations they are doing this in a couple of different parts one they are trying to find white men who are going to pay homage to ket harris as a woman to make all the single ladies feel really good and then they are trying to find white women who are willing to pay homage to kl harris as a black woman this is full intersection it on display in the kam harris campaign so if you like what you are seeing in the campaign get ready for that in the presidency intersectionality which again is the theory that everyone is describable by their group characteristics and we can then rank how we ought to treat people based on their level of victimization based on group characteristics so for example white woman more victimized than white man black woman more victimized than white woman and that means that a white woman can not speak to a black woman and a white man can not speak to a white woman if you like that in the campaign get ready for that in the presidency because this is absolutely what kamala harris 's candidacy stands for on a political level this also means that what the kamla harris campaign is attempting to do by breaking apart all of these groups and this is what they have done they have like black gay and queer men for kamla harris and last night they had a group called white dudes for kamala had a big meeting white dudes for kamala some like 30,000 men showed up on this zoom call white dudes for for kamala and what it really was was not a bunch of people who supportive of k harris it was a struggle session in which white dudes declared themselves subservient to both women and also to black women because this is the essence of intersectionality so every speaker was an upper class college educated or extraordinarily wealthy hollywood liberal talking about their privilege and how because of their privilege they had to demonstrate to the world that kamla harris was the candidate for them not because she 's well - qualified not because she is amazing at her job not because they agree with her policies but because it is just so important based on intersectional characteristics to support kamla harris white dudes for kamla it is kind of a fake because it 's not really about white dudes at all sort of like the stability of the united states dollar see since 1974 saudi arabia has sold oil solely in american dollars which was huge for our global economic dominance now they would like other options if there 's less demand for the us dollar what happens to its value it 's for reasons like this i feel it 's important to diversify some of your savings

now that is not an outreach strategy for blue collar men this is why you have seen the entire political conversation shift from michigan wisconsin pennsylvania down to like geor ggia arizona north carolina the reason is because the states where this is likely to play are states with large cities with a lot of single women living in them because single women tend to congregate generally speaking in bigger cities and also more racially diverse states because they are hoping to drive out minority turnout for kam hara she pulls better with minorities than joe biden did she pulls worse with rural whites than than joe biden did so there 's been an attempt to shift the map",0.4911,"and if you are if you cost five or ten or a hundred dollars to use bitcoin it 's eggwin and it costs a penny to use bitcoin cash it 's clear so you have you been accepting donations on your website i think you got most of those donations before the price of bitcoin transactions skyrocketed and the reason the price

ten people were using bitcoin every 10 minutes so you could do it for fur in your transaction will be included now that bitcoin is this worldwide phenomenon more than two thousand people are trying to use bitcoin every 10 minutes",0.6753,but you are accusing the daily wire of bending over for big tech to avoid penalties they do the same thing that crowder does nobody wants to cut off their nose to spite their face let us keep dissecting this story point by point he keeps saying that a friend would not offer that kind of contract what kind of contract where you could keep doing your show while getting paid 50 million dollars and the only thing that you would have to do different is do some ad reads from sponsors but the daily wire can not pay him 50 million dollars if they can not reach the same audience with their advertisers if he gets banned from a platform so he would get a pay cut if he got banned from a platform like itunes or spotify or youtube and technically this was not even a contract it was a term sheet it was a rough draft document meant to start a discussion and a negotiation about a possible contract in the future that would be drawn up based on what they agreed upon crowder also says that he 's just worried about the little people it 's not about him at all it 's about the young up and coming youtubers that may get screwed by this kind of contract and not even for me but for other people coming up facing these kinds of contracts like brett cooper the 20 year old girl making tons of money and happy with her contract with the daily wire who did a whole instagram live stream about how grateful she is to work for them because they launched her youtube channel for her and got her over a million subscribers in just a few months and i am incredibly incredibly grateful for the opportunity and the privilege to be here and work with these horrible people um and like i said it 's not slavery which is what stephen crowder called it it 's a privilege she does not even have to touch a camera or edit her own videos or set up lights her videos are shot in the daily wire studio but because of that she does not own her show because she does not produce it she do not even start the youtube channel and just like jay leno does not own the tonight show she does not own the comments section that 's the name of her show if you are not familiar with it now about the ownership of crowder 's show he was making it seem like the daily wire would own his entire show in perpetuity which means forever once the contract was up here crowder is either highly misunderstood or most likely lying again jeremy boring even said on the tape phone call that stephen crowder 's secret live recorded of his friend of 10 years that the daily wire only owns the content that they produce clearly meaning in crowder 's case if they produced any films for stephen like they did with matt walsh for his what is a woman documentary that kind of content they would own there 's nothing revealed on that phone call that was a bombshell or even remotely surprising it was common sense what jeremy boring was saying and the reason the daily wire would have exclusive rights to his show during the contract is so he could not turn around and sell it to newsmax or somewhere else and then make revenue over there as well and dilute the viewership for the daily wires version just like the tonight show is on nbc exclusively they can not turn around and then also air it on comedy central at the same time i have been in this business for over 15 years i have been to hollywood many times i have sat in the offices at the history channel hbo discovery channel sci - fi channel i have been in pilots for showtime and other networks that never got picked up and featured in other shows that aired on some of those networks so i know how these things work a lot of people think that he had to record the call for his protection it was a business call they say no it was two months after negotiations had ended and he called specifically to get audio to use in his publicity stunts there was no need to record the call for his protection because all contracts have a very clear clause that says anything promised or even alluded to in discussions or emails or anywhere else means nothing only what 's in the contract that way nobody can later claim that someone said if they signed it they would get a lamborghini for their birthday so there was no need to record the call to protect himself from getting screwed and again the negotiations were over two months earlier not to mention it was shady as hell highly unethical and in many states illegal and why is it against stephen that you will not release the entire call from start to finish anytime a youtuber who already has a channel joins an mcn they license all of their videos to the mcn a multi - channel network the mcn does not own the videos it 's a lease basically anyone who has ever joined an mcn knows this this is youtube 101 if you get to the level where you are a full - time youtuber everybody knows this the mcn then monetizes the videos and gets you sponsors in the form of ad reads steven produces his own show in his own studio so the daily wire with license rights to it so that they could say that he 's part of the daily wire,0.1786,the washington post is reporting that the corona virus is not mutating significantly as it circulates through the human population very good news hevy mutations in coronavirus would mean that a vaccine develop do not actually be supremely effective because it 's moved on to a different strain scientists are closely studying the novel 's the novel pathogens pathogens genetic code say that this thing is not mutating significantly that relative stability suggests the virus is less likely to become more or less dangerous as it spreads and represents encouraging news for researchers hoping to create a long - lasting vaccine all viruses do evolve over time but this thing seems to be a dumb virus in the sense it is not acquiring information all that fast the new corona virus has proofreading machinery and that reduces the error rate and thus the pace of mutation it looks pretty much the same everywhere and thus it is not adapting to local populations and becoming more and more deadly sars cova - the virus that causes the disease covin 19 is similar to corona viruses that circulate naturally in bats it probably jumped through a penguin which people have been eating do not eat the dam 's bats and penguins and it 's not culturally insensitive you idiots just do not do it i do not care if you are white green or blue do not eat the damned penguins how many times we have to do this my god scientists are now studying more than a thousand different samples of the virus peter thiel and a molecular geneticist at johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory who 's been studying the virus told the washington post there are only about four to ten genetic differences between the strains that had infected people in the us and the original virus that spread in wuhan that is very good news an other piece of good news the fda is now accelerating a lot of the treatments that are becoming available to the general public which is good i mean there are a lot of people who literally need treatment like right now or you know being treated with ventilators or in grave condition and they need a treatment right now the fda has begun to allow doctors to treat some patients with the blood plasma of patients who have recovered from corona virus caused kovan 19 disease the treatment must be approved on a case - by - case basis patients have to meet certain conditions according to the fda the treatment is considered investigational based on the possibility that convalescent plasma a portion of whole blood from recovered victims may contain antibodies to the virus that may be effective against the infection so we have the same blood type and the person has recovered from coronavirus you grab some of their blood put it in your body now their blood is carrying the antibodies to fight off the infection is the idea the agency stressed convalescent plasma has not been shown to be effective and every disease studied the plan is for clinical studies of the procedure to begin one of the hard things about clinical studies in the midst of a pandemic is the clinical studies generally require a a compare a population a control population of a population that is not going to get the treatment how many people are going to volunteer to be part of a study where they are the control population if you are in serious trouble the last thing you want to be is part of the control population you want the treatment the agency said it 's taking this unusual early step because of the rapidly rising numbers of coronavirus patients and deaths in the united states blood plasma must be collected only from people are eligible otherwise to give blood so hopefully new treatments coming about meanwhile we are hearing more and more cases of prominent people with corona virus there 's a basketball player on karl - anthony towns his mom apparently is on a ventilator now and we know that there is a person who worked for the new york times who passed away yesterday of a corona virus there was also a famous broadway playwright who passed away he was 81 he was in poor condition already prince charles has tested positive for komono virus he 'd been experiencing mild symptoms for days otherwise his remain in good health according to a statement released by the princes official residence the duchess of cornwall has been tested but does not have the virus that be referring to prince charles 's wife both are now self isolating in their home in scotland it 's not clear exactly when he caught it or how he caught it but prominent people are going to get this thing and most of these problem people are recovering,0.5216,"around a century ago the spanish flu killed 700,000 people in this country in terms of casualty count the that pandemic was deadlier than both world wars plus the wars in vietnam and korea combined the average life expectancy in this country dropped by 12 years virtually overnights and many of the dead were young people and yet as the pandemic subsided according to historians who have extensively documented this whole episode life returned to normal in just a couple of years society did not reorder itself there were no permanent changes to say election law mailin balloting do not become the norm clusters of a fet leftists in san francisco and portland do not insist on wearing masks for years afterwards things uh progressed and people just kind of moved on with their lives now fast forward a century to the postco era and as you have probably noticed the exact opposite happened instead of moving on elected officials have opted to indefinitely extend covid policies wherever possible and some of these efforts are obvious i just alluded to a few of them but some of these efforts are not so obvious in fact they have gotten basically no major media coverage whatsoever with few exceptions even though they could affect your children in profound ways in particular with co as the pretext initially there 's now a large scale effort underway to transform schools into mini hospitals all for the benefit of a handful of startups that are funded out of silicon valley now you thought the point of school was to provide an education for your child but that 's not the case anymore it has not been the case for a long time really now the point is to turn students into patients in order to enrich investors in california school is now supposedly a one - stop shop for all your children 's educational and medical and psychiatric needs according to research from the kaiser family foundation prior to co there were quote essentially zero telea health appointments for mental health and substance related issues you could look throughout the entire country and and uh you 'd find that it 's just not something that was done but beginning around march of 2021 everything changed and that year tella health technology exploded in popularity it was used for um more than one - third of all outpatient visits for these symptoms and tellah health then went from something that basically no one used to something that more than 33 % of patients nationwide were participating in and nothing like that kind of shift has ever happened before many of these new patients were students in grades k through 12 and as the associated press reports this week quote now at least 16 of the 20 largest us public school districts are offering online therapy sessions to reach millions of students in those districts alone schools have signed provider contracts worth more than $ 70 million have you heard about that unless you read the ap probably not and you were never asked to vote on that you were never asked to vote on whether schools will become also uh places where therapy is is is uh conducted for 10 of millions of dollars it just happened whether you like it or not one of the largest tele health providers in in schools today is called hazel health they are active in more than 150 school districts across 15 states and just this year the ap reports hazel signed a $ 24 million contract with lo los angeles county to provide teletherapy to more than a million students hazel has also signed lucrative deals in hawaii nevada florida texas washington georgia a lot of taxpayer money is being spent all of a sudden on in school therapy for kids so that 's tens of millions more dollars spent by the school system to go along with the billions that it already wastes but the bigger issue beyond the cost of all this is that schools should not be handling any of this in the first place this is maybe the most egregious example of mission creep in modern history like it should go without saying that schools are not hospitals and they are certainly not mental health facilities outside of dealing with minor injuries which school nurses can handle and have always been able to handle schools should not be offering fullservice medical care least of all psychiatric care they certainly should not be promoting mental health treatments via the internet now this this is the biggest problem and the thing we should all be stopping to think about why are schools spending tens of millions of dollars to offer therapy to kids now it used to be like back my day back in the dark ages that the school guidance counselor was really just like the school 's version of an hr rep for students so you 'd talk to the guidance counselor if you had some kind of issue uh with another student or a teacher or whatever and most of the time she would give you a sticker or a coloring book and send you on your way so the guidance counselor 's role was relatively narrow in that way but now increasingly schools are taking it upon themselves to play shrink they are referring to children children they are referring children to zoom calls with anonymous doctors for talk therapy and parents have no idea what exactly is being said in these sessions it 's true that parents you know have to consent to these tah health providers seeing their children to begin with but beyond that the whole point of the practice is that parents do not have to come you know and get their kids parents can stay at work they can stay at their job and meanwhile a teleah health provider is free to say affirm a child 's gender delusions or misdiagnose a serious illness now there are a lot of issues here and one and not even the biggest one is the quality of care that kids will receive time magazine looked into this back in november of 2022 and they reported at the time that quote time interviewed six mental health professionals who formerly worked for tesy or substance treatment startups some of whom asked to remain anonymous because they still work in mental health care regardless of their employer they had similar complaints appointments were too short to properly treat and assess patients cl clinicians were overworked and policies around prescribing drugs and treating complex cases often were not rigorous enough time also reported that quote federal investigators are probing prescription practices at dun and cerebral a popular startup that offers virtual therapy and medication management for depression anxiety insomnia adhd bipolar disorder and substance use disorders for as little as $ 99 per month and that some former employees have have said overprescribed stimulants for adhd in may pharmacy giants including c cvs and walmart stopped filling controlled substance prescriptions from cerebral and dun cl clinicians now for its part the wall street journal found that quote dun run by a former facebook product manager with no medical training also advertises heavily on social media dun 's clinicians continue to prescribe stimulants sometimes after appointments as short as 10 minutes so more broadly when when people go to tele health providers they are often being misdiagnosed researchers at the mayo clinic looked at around 2400 patients who underwent a video tella health consultation followed by an in - person visit for the same problem and they found that in 133 % of cases the diagnosis do not match up so they are being told one thing from the tella health provider and then something entirely different from the person they actually saw in person and that might not seem like a lot 133 % and indeed the mayoo clinic touts this as a positive number",0.544,and he does not really have much convincing to say about the massive inflation rate he also does not have much to say about the giant train explosion in ohio in east palestine like he nothing from the president of the united states about creating a giant toxic mushroom cloud directly outside of a of a town of 5 000 people and poisoning the groundwater apparently nothing from nothing for the president about that there 's a lot to say about lead in the pipes during his state of the union address nothing about his epa blowing up trains filled with toxic materials nothing nothing there but he does have some words about gun control he 's lying again by the way here was joe biden yesterday he 's pushing gun control in the aftermath of a mass shooting at michigan state university and uh here he was yesterday doing this routine to the families who lost a piece of their soul i have some idea how hard it is today brings us all back everybody back just like you heard the news a moment ago but what i admire most about all of you is how you found purpose through your pain you have helped me take more executive actions reduce gun violence than any of my predecessors at this point in their presidencies we have reined in ghost guns crackdown on gun trafficking increased resources for violence prevention and we stood together as i signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years but there 's so much more to do we have to ban assault weapons like the one used in parkland they used just five years ago today and in so many of the mass shootings in america for the lives lost the lives we can save as a nation we must say enough now enough i would like to point out here that um as always this is completely disconnected from reality the msu shooter used a handgun so banning assault weapons would have achieved precisely zero things a a mass shooter shoots people with a handgun and joe biden 's solution is what if we ban an ar-15 we ban a long gun genius level stuff again from our genius president as the washington examiner also points out this person was already breaking the law and it turns out that a local d.a let this person off the hook for what would have been a felony gun charge a couple of years ago well once again it was a preventable shooting it could not have been prevented by passing more gun control laws it could have been prevented if local prosecutors had existed had enforced existing gun laws the shooter was arrested in 2019 and charged with carrying a concealed pistol without a concealed carry permit this is a felony it carries a potential five - year prison sentence and would have prevented the shooter from being permitted to own a firearm once his sentence was up instead he pled down to possession of a loaded firearm in a vehicle which is a misdemeanor and then prosecutors dismiss the felony charge and he served 18 months probation and remained eligible to purchase and own guns so again well done soft on crime prosecutors letting people off the hook and then the person goes on to commit a crime and joe biden 's solution is ban the long guns this administration is such a disaster area and the disaster area permeates every area of the administration,0.5654
i think that for somebody with a robust gut microbiome who you know i think people should be able to tolerate and not just tolerate but to derive you know a health benefit from you know many of these so - called plant defense compounds you know even cruciferous vegetables which have become demonized in certain carnivore circles you know due to you know certain uh glucosinolate compounds or compound like sulphoraphane which you know there are actual randomized human trials that show that these compounds can actually help us detoxify from some of these environmental pollutants that we know you know play a role in disease um obviously you can get a certain uh dose if you will of phytochemicals from eating animal source foods but you know carotenoids like lutin and zanthin which we know are very beneficial to brain health you know you are not going to see a better you are not going to find a better source of them in the supermarket than kale for example which people love to hate on but foods like kale spinach dark leafy greens cruciferous vegetables i think that the i do think that for most people the benefits outweigh the risk you know um if an elimination diet where you remove all fruits and vegetables um for a time helps i think that 's amazing,0.1089,donald trump will not say if we will accept the results of the election here 's one from pbs trump will not accept election results if he loses to loses as clinton expands campaign into red states october 21st 2016 and then of course you have the actual potential for fraud which or i am sorry so those are the older stories but as of now i show you this because there is an actual probability that there will be some fraud that i am kind of already seeing in which case even though people have mentioned in the past trump will not accept the results you do not have the same thing back then as yet have you had as you have today well let us go now to the pollster who predicted 2016 now saying donald trump will win in 2020 and what this means hevy says a new wisconsin poll shows president donald trump with a small lead over joe biden the poll is by trafalgar group a pollster that correctly predicted trump would win the electoral college in 2016 trafalgar group had had the only poll showing trump winning the battleground states of pennsylvania and michigan in the last election the group also correctly predicted that trump would win north carolina most other polls got it wrong the trafalgar group 's 2020 wisconsin and michigan polls are outliers this year too as most other polls show joe biden breaking out with significant leaves of the president so you get the general idea they go on to say that they spoke with them and they are they are predicting what many are not but if we move forward now based on those outliers who are saying trump might actually win these swing states i highlight that dimension maybe newsweek 's prediction is wrong but take a look at this professor who predicted trump 's 2016 win explains why he thinks trump will win again and this this was from may 29th the story was then repeated on june 20th trump 's primary vote totals trout 's previous incumbents numbers with no serious challenges for the republican party nomination and high approval numbers among the gop rank - and - file trump could have cruise through the spring campaign season like most incumbent presidents do instead he traveled to 18 states for campaign rallies and spent more than a hundred and fifty five million dollars to rack up high primary vote totals for a nomination he had no chance of losing his work it 's interesting i do not remember any uncontested primary campaign for a sitting president like this stony brook university professor helmut north nor poll nor pathes told at the post people do not normally turn out in large numbers for a race without a challenger but in 23 of the 27 states that held primaries both this year in 2012 when president obama ran for the for real trump has racked up higher raw vote totals that obama did often doubling or tripling his predecessors numbers his primary vote totals also beat george w bush 's in 2004 the high trump turnout showed up not only in reliably republican states like montana and arkansas but even in deep blue strongholds and in purple states that joe biden hopes to flip come november yes the enthusiasm gap we get it more people they just love to vote trump and they are not backing down if joe biden can not muster this vote then why would we expect trump to lose well they are saying he 's going to lose first i bring you back to the year 2016 who will win the presidency hillary clinton 71 point for donald trump twenty eight point six and as we know trump actually won and i bring you now to another forecast model that as joe biden at 87 point four and donald trump at twelve point six are we just seeing the same thing play out over all over again i do not know the media might be wrong though for a few reasons they are betting on people voting for joe biden but what if the far left defects and votes green party third party or bernie and joe biden gets him a minority donald trump gets a minority but donald trump gets the plurality then donald trump wins or everybody loses what happens if no one reaches 270 electoral votes or what happens if donald trump wins 271 because democrats split it 's possible,0.3692,so i will give you a little sample of what 's inside starting with the introduction the differences between liberals and conservatives used to be pretty clear - cut and well - known to those who paid even the least bit of attention to politics people generally knew where someone with opposing political views stood on important issues involving immigration gun control abortion war gay marriage social welfare programs etc well not everyone has always been clearly defined by the general attributes of what the usual core beliefs are of someone who is a republican or a democrat the primary differences and objectives of each ideology have been deeply rooted and widely understood historically they have been compelling arguments put forth by both sides of a debate but recently the seemingly endless tug - of - war between the left and the right took a dramatic turn the less well established counter positions some of which had at least been reasonable on the surface have been replaced by a variety of new and bizarre ideas that are hard to even take seriously let alone understand it is as if we are living in an episode of the twilight zone where we are witnessing an outbreak of some strange mass psychosis that 's sweeping across the country we are seeing the mainstream media hollywood celebrities and professors on college campuses promoting such preposterous agendas about race sexuality and life in general that it 's impossible in many cases to distinguish their ideas from satire poking fun at them liberalism has ballooned into a mental health crisis and it 's not just an epidemic of odd behaviors and proposed new laws from a small number of disturbed individuals who in the past would be featured as circus freaks or guests on the jerry springer show their positions are being embraced endorsed and promoted by the liberal media establishment and the entertainment industrial complex not only are these once fringe individuals and beliefs being glorified and celebrated by the media but there are also a growing number of laws in corporate policies being put in place that demand everyone else except these lunatics and their behavior as if they are totally normal facebook now recognizes literally countless genders after first expanding the options from the old - fashioned male and female 258 different gender options in 2014 but that was not inclusive enough so now the gender list is not even a checkbox with either male or female it 's a fill in the blank where you can list anything from peanut butter to an attack helicopter as your gender the state of new york now legally recognizes 31 genders and made it a crime if you do not refer to someone as their preferred pronoun that means if someone identifies as gender non - binary you can not refer to them as a he or a she some people are now identifying as dragons elves and even aliens equally insane views on race and sexuality are spreading you probably heard some of this lunacy but unless you have been monitoring the trend closely for the last several years what you have seen and heard is only the tip of the iceberg beneath the surface is an epidemic of utter madness it 's trying to rise up and take control of our culture criticizing much of this new liberal agenda has been deemed hate speech by the leftists and they are increasing their levels of violence in order to intimidate those who speak out against them we have seen a growing trend of violence on college campuses by students determined to stop conservative speakers from giving talks the perpetrators justify their terrorist behavior by labeling speech and ideas violence and claim the day must then use violence to stop what they say is a fascist ideology from being adopted by conservatives we are simply arguing against this modern - day liberalism it 's not commonplace for those on the left to defame average conservatives and trump supporters as white supremacists and nazis which has created a dangerous political climate not seen in america in recent history leftists encouraging and celebrating violence against trump supporters is a regular occurrence on social media many have equated the red make america great again hat with the nazi swastika and a wave of anti - trump mass hysteria has swept across the country throughout history cultures around the world have thought that strange behaviors like inserting large plates into their lips or stretching the necks of the members of their tribes was completely normal performing other dangerous body modifications like head and foot binding we are a standard practice in some societies but today we look back and marvel at these primitive cultures and have a hard time understanding how such unhealthy and unnatural acts were conceived let alone seen as normal hopefully the same will be true in our future and we can look back at how liberals almost unraveled the basic fabric of society because of their poisonous ideas but thankfully we were able to rein in the craziness and restore normalcy but only time will tell if we can not put an end to their madness soon the human race will be psychologically scattered in a million different directions and crawling all over each other trying to survive like a bunch of ants after someone steps on their colony maybe crazy people have too much time on their hands these days since idle hands are the devil 's workshop as the saying goes or maybe what would have been a fleeting curiosity by a few isolated mentally unstable individuals has been given a breeding ground since different people with the same bizarre fetishes and delusions can now connect with each other through the internet and instead of having friends it would discourage these kinds of abnormalities they find strangers halfway across the country who share in their madness and foment it 's logic and science are no longer accepted by a growing number of leftists in fact different points of view from what they hold are not allowed anymore they feel that real - life interactions should be identical to their social media feeds where they can customize who they follow and exactly what they see in here as well as who they can block out with the tap of a finger their life has become a bubble they think should be their own personalized safe space utopia filled with only things they like without any opposition disagreements or challenges but that 's not how the real world works and they are very upset about it and when they get upset they get even more unstable the only rational explanation for why this is happening is that the liberal establishment is strategically trying to unravel the social fabric of society as part of a hostile takeover the basic unit of this fabric is the nuclear family and as liberal activist linda gordon said quote the nuclear family must be destroyed whatever its ultimate meaning the breakup of families is now an objective revolutionary process destroy the family and the long - established traditions of the human race will vanish and people will be left without any support structure instilling morality loyalty responsibility or spirituality the government will decide what is right and wrong and provide basic needs such as food shelter and financial assistance or as george orwell wrote in 1984 one of the primary aims of the tyrannical government in his book called the party was quote to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control we are under attack by those who want to grow the government so large and powerful that it will be an all - encompassing entity that is involved with every facet of our lives they want the government to become god a lot of this insanity started on college campuses in the early 2000 and tens colleges the first time kids are completely free from parental supervision and is the beginning of a new life it 's often in a new city with new people new places to explore new ideas to think about and an opportunity to shed the labels and restrictions they have had following them around since middle school or high school they are also still very impressionable and can easily be convinced to believe radical ideas no matter how irrational or impractical recent studies show that adolescence lasts until the age of 24 which means that a person is not really an adult until two years after they graduate college assuming they went to college which you do not need to do to have a good career but instead of preparing kids for the real world many college professors seek to indoctrinate them with their own radical liberal agendas and in this safe space culture they have created instead of growing up many students are actually regressing their minds are filled with useless and unrealistic ideas about how the world works and many get so fixated on past injustice --is that they can not navigate through our modern society without seeing everything through a distorted lens that stuck looking in the past the books not available in stores by the way so we have to go to amazon.com or downloaded onto your tablet or your reading device and there 's a link in the description below to the amazon listing let us continue with elementary school kids having their own cell phones and tablets they now have access to a dangerous online world filled with youtubers and social media stars who introduced them to ideas and activities no children should be subjected to parents are at a loss and feel that if they do not let their kids have a smartphone or a tablet their classmates will ostracize them since everyone else has one and preventing them from consuming inappropriate content once one is in their hands is impossible so children are being raised by viral videos trending topics and social media stars instead of parents and it 's setting up society for a disaster of unimaginable proportions today 's children are growing up in a sea of attention - seeking tweets and instagram posts and each have a million different things screaming for their attention and try to take as much of it as possible ruining their capacity to concentrate their long - term memory and even their ability to think as media analysts neil postman noted they are amusing themselves to death the memorials have been called the lost generation because most of them can not fix anything in their cars or around the house one survey claimed that 12 % to people under the age of 35 do not even know how to change a light bulb another famous study even suggested that people now have the attention span of a goldfish and can only focus on a subject for eight seconds before their mind it starts to wander it 's probably not a coincidence that 's about as much time as it takes to read a tweet or look over an instagram post the younger generations are now so desensitized and have been so dehumanized that when they see someone get injured in an accident or assaulted on the street their first thought is to pull out a cell phone and take a picture a record video of the situation so they can post it on social media instead of calling for help or actually helping the victims themselves despite this cruelty they think that they are helping make the world a better place they go out of their way to virtually signal to others that they are good people by supporting the latest trendy social justice warrior causes as the urban decay explains virtue signaling is to take conspicuous but essentially useless action ostensibly to support a good cause but usually to show off how much more moral you are than everybody else every day more people seem to get further detached from reality and sink deeper into a synthetic world of contradictions and confusions when conservatives make a joke now many liberals think that we are being serious when liberals are being serious sometimes we think they must be joking the story about a 34 year old man who identifies as a six year old and dominates the crossfit kids class is a parody but the one about a man in his 50s identifying as a six year old is not in the 1990s men dressing up as women was the common occurrence and sketch comedy z ' and sitcoms but now men who dress up as women are participating in weightlifting competitions in ufc fights against actual women and dominating them many people are wondering what happened to free speech in america since anyone who questions this growing madness is denounced as a fascist or a hateful bigot everything is racist to liberals but blacks can not be racist because they are always the victim they say and racism always comes from white people who are seen as the cause of all of society 's problems the snowflakes now complain about thanksgiving because it reminds them of what the early settlers did to the native americans remember when we used to call the minions well that 's too offensive today as well,0.1731,but instead what you have typically is people who do not like the fact that the police have to do rough things to rough people in order to maintain the peace and so they yell at the cops every time they see a tape of something that does not look like what they would do because a normal civilian deescalation technique is to walk away from a conflict that 's normally what deescalation looks like for those of us who are not members of the police for example well what that 's resulting in is people simply walking away from the job of policing the harder we have made it for our police officers the fewer poli police officers there are the fewer police officers there are the more you have cities like washington dc that have been completely taken over by crime and the generalized attitude toward cops which moved from defund the police which is way too out there way too loud even democrats ran away from that slogan screaming by late 2020 because of the increase in crime rates to demoralize the police demoralize the police remains the way that we now do policing in the united states this is a point being made by heather mcdonald over at city journal she says on january 3rd the new york city council passed the how many stops act over the veto of mayor eric adams the law requires new york police officers to fill out a form nearly every time they interact with a civilian if for example an officer asks a potential bystander to a shooting if he had witnessed that shooting the officer will have to complete a form listing the bystanders race sex and age are there other potential witnesses in the area who urgently need to be contacted before they disperse too bad identity - based paperwork comes first but that act is innocuous compared with california 's data collection requirements for police officers new reporting obligations under the racial and identity profiling act now require california officers to fill out an8 page form with nearly 200 fields when they make what is known as a custodial stop meaning the civilian is not free to walk away the form generated by the california doj comes straight from the race and gender studies classroom the officer first documents whether he the officer is a cisgender man cisgender woman transgender man transgender woman or non - binary person to avoid placing a retrogressive gender straight jacket on the state 's public service the form also allows an offer officer to check both non - bar binary person and cisgender woman for example the officer must list a sexual identity there 's also an extensive officer race or ethnicity section then the officer has to document the civilians perceived sexual orientation lgb plus or straight heterosexual and the civilians perceived gender cisgender transgender or non - binary the discerning officer is allowed to surmise that the person they have stopped is more than one california created this form as heather mcdonald points out to jin up anti - p police narratives once an officer 's identity profile is merged with of the person stop the possibilities of finding some form of identity oppression are virtually endless,0.5549,well president joe biden is in a tough spot you see last week donald trump his chief political opponent was convicted on 34 felony counts of and joe biden said that the justice system had worked in fact any talk about the justice system not working was undermining our democracy was undermining our institutions well now joe biden 's son hunter is in the dock in wilmington delaware on federal gun charges because it turns out that he pretty clearly lied on his gun registration form that when he went to buy a gun he clearly was a drug addict he lied on his forms about being a drug addict and all of that culminated in a situation in which his girlfriend who at the time was his brother 's widow which again she apparently was so afraid of hunter having a gun that she took it she drove it over to a local store tossed it in a trash can which happened to be near a school secret service then tried to cover it up then as you will recall this was looked into by joe biden 's doj and there were whistleblowers who came forward alleging that the biden doj had essentially hamstrung prosecutors from investigating hunter biden 's involvement with his father joe and went out of their way to cut some sort of deal to close the tax case that was also being investigated against hunter biden there were two simultaneous cases being investig investigated against hunter biden one was the gun charge the other was the fact that hunter biden has spent his entire adult life traveling around the globe picking up sacks of cash on behalf of the biden family because joe biden is an extraordinarily corrupt politician on behalf of his own family literally every adult member of his family has trafficked in joe biden 's name in order to make money with joe biden 's permission and or involvement so there was a full scale tax investigation going on whistleblowers came forward and they said that joe biden 's doj had been told to basically look the other way on the tax investigation this all came to a head to when it turned out that the doj tried to cut a sweetheart deal with hunter biden wherein he would be essentially directed to rehab for his drug problem and as part of the plea agreement all the tax charges would simply go away they would randomly be dismissed and the judge in that particular case looked at this plea agreement and said this makes no sense how how is this how is this okay why is it my job to excuse him on the tax charges because you are trying to sign some sort of agreement with him on the drug charges and she asked the prosecution are you actually freeing him up on on the tax charges they said no and the defense said well if you are not freeing him up on the tax charges then we are not taking the deal we are not going to plead guilty in any way if you are not going to free up on the tax charges so basically the prosecution and the defense had gotten together and they decided to try to sneak one past the judge the judge said no the whole thing blew up and this is how you end up with a prosecution in wilmington delaware on these gun charges now this is an open and shut case it is an open and shut case it is obvious that hunter biden lied on his federal drug forms on his federal gun forms rather according to the wall street journal on a friday evening in october 2018 hunter biden rolled up in a black cadillac to starquest shooters and survival supply in the delaware city where he had been born and raised a salesman standing in the window do not initially recognize him as the son of the states 's longtime democratic senator now president biden and would later recall declining a tip from the younger biden as he purchased a 38 caliber colt cobra revolver however it turns out that hunter in fact was a drug addict at the time many of the jurors know the biden family of course a jury of six men and six women along with for alternate was ultimately impanel late on monday afternoon today federal prosecutors and biden 's lawyers are slated to deliver their opening statements to the jury president biden did put out a statement on all of this his statement said quot i am the president,0.6088,so terrible well um there 's only one problem the reason that she is disfigured is because she attempted to blow up a car bomb and the battery acid hit her that is the reason she she disfigured herself she just figured herself she was arrested after her car exploded at a checkpoint did it did it just did it just randomly explode did it randomly explode or was it a car bomb here 's a cnn journalist similarly claiming moral parity between small children released by hamas thanks to israel 's military pressure and palestinians released by israel in order to free those children uh israeli authorities blocked off roads coralled the media into one location um brought the palestinians in uh through the back door when they received them and then only allowed family members to come in very limited single file in individual cars and there 's a reason for that because unlike uh the images of celebration where you which you might have seen from ramala and the west bank here in east jerusalem israeli authorities were better able to enforce the dictat of their far - right national security minister who has who has deemed the prisoners released today as terrorists but not just that he said any palestinian who celebrates will themselves be charged as terrorists i mean just to break down break break that down a little bit there is no grounds to call them terrorists because by israel 's own reckoning those 39 prisoners were uh 15 minors 10 of whom were only charged and 24 women 23 were sorry were detained not charged and 10 of the minors were detained not charged the for for terrorism that 's why why they were detained for stabbing attacks and throwing molets of cocktails of course the asinine xiji hadid did the same thing using as her model of victimhood when ammed al manara accusing israel of taking children as p 's engaging in abduction rape humiliation torture murder of palestinians she tweeted out israel is the only country in the world that keeps children as prisoners of war right that children as prisoners of war abduction rape humiliation torture murder of palestinians years and years before october 7th ahmed al manara abducted by the israeli occup at the age of 12 has endured solitary confinement hundreds of palestinian children remain detained suffering in israeli jails um here is some actual video of what ahmed did so that would be ahmed chasing jews toward a um toward a gas station running into the gas station with the knife looking for somebody to stab and then um settling eventually on uh they they eventually settled he and the other person he 's with settled on the murder of a 13 - year - old boy that 's the game it 's always the same game you pretend moral parity between israel and its enemies you ignore all evidence in order to accomplish this this allows for the continuation of that egregiously false narrative that israel 's elimination is a legitimate goal or that israel ought to be forced to make concessions to terrorist groups which are by the way the only governing powers in the west bank and the gaza strip fat for example is the military wing of the palestinian authority it is run by mahmud abas that 's supposed to be israel 's peace partner that 's the person joe biden wants to see running gaza after kamas well over the weekend the secretary general of fat 's central committee shib rajub stated that october 7th was quote an act in the context of the defensive war our people are waging and that quote hamas is part of our political and social fabric and of our struggle their involvement is important ruba also said that hamas 's onslot quote forwarded the goal of the israeli right to integrate israel into the region without resolving the palestinian issue based on the principle of of peace in exchange for peace those are the moderates the non - m moderates spent the weekend murdering and mutilating the bodies of two supposed collaborators with israel here are some of the images of that atrocity it 's literally palestinians they they executed two men and mutilated their bodies in front of giant crowds they mutilated them and they hanged them up people shouting cheering notice the cell phones and notice the cheering and here in again lies the problem if there is no moral parity there can be no two - state solution under these circumstances not remotely not with kamas not with the pa not with palestinian islamic jihad not with any of the parties on the table and that is not likely to change anytime soon so what are the legacy media to do well they have a few options left when the narrative that kamas is kind to the old women and kids they have kidnapped does not fly well first they can argue that kamas has no agency after all they are really the victims of circumstance in fact as it turns turn out israel is to blame for kamas after all only the jews have agency thus according to steve hendrick and ham bala of the washington post by the way that 's an outlet that has disgraced itself beyond measure as a kamas propaganda outlet during this conflict they say the real fault here is wait for it benjamin netanyahu the israeli prime minister according to the washington post netanyahu and hamas quote found each other useful for their own purposes netanyahu pursued a strategy that do not disrupt the status quo of a divided palestinian population leaving kamas to ruling gaza and the rival palestinian authority in the west bank leave aside the fact that had israel moved to depose hamas over the past 20 years the world would have condemned them for it in fact every time israel went in to clean out hamas actors the world condemned them leave aside the fact that the palestinian authority currently allies with kamas and is also a terrorist group the insane bigotry of suggesting that the jews are responsible for radical muslim atrocities because they do not defend those radical muslims while you are currently arguing by the way that israel ought not defend kamas is totally mindboggling so just just to get this logic straight bb is bad because he do not depose kamas bb therefore must not depose kamas right now,1.045,last thursday feminist writer and podcaster megan murphy tweeted her observation that men are not women twitter promptly suspended murphy for hate speech as somebody who 's been banned from twitter for making completely innocuous statements before i feel for murphy she is now experiencing as a leftist the same targeting and censorship that big tech companies inflict on conservatives on a daily basis but i can not help but feel just a teeny tiny supremely satisfying tinge of schadenfreude as the left 's ideological chickens come home to roost the problem is clear the left can have transgenderism or feminism but it can not have both murphy correctly observes that trans gender ideology which believes that gender is fluid and socially constructed undermines feminism which advocates the advancement of women a real and essential gender category what murphy does not seem to understand however is that the root of this new censorious anti woman ideology of transgenderism lies in feminism itself first wave feminists of the 18th and 19th century women like mary wollstonecraft and elizabeth cady stanton acknowledged and celebrated the differences between the sexes both of them were married elizabeth cady stanton actually was married to the co - founder of the republican party just a little aside they do not hate men they do not hate the natural differences between men and women by the 1960s however radical feminists of the second wave women like shula meth firestone rejected the complementarity of the sexes shulman firestone called the love between men and women the single greatest impediment to women 's liberation and she sought to deconstruct gender categories all together in this very extreme view sexual difference necessarily impedes equality therefore no distinction between men and women may be tolerated now 50 years later it 's that very premise that threatens to destroy the feminist ideology that begot it all together the left can have transgenderism or it can have feminism it can not have both either men can not be women or there is no such thing as a woman either men and women are distinct categories or to quote plan parenthood back in march some men have a uterus if some men have a uterus that is to say if some men are women then what exactly is a woman if the sexes are the same or they are only superficially different they are only different in a trivial way then why do we have different words man and woman to describe the same thing further if there 's no categorical distinction between man and woman that is to say if there is no real difference between the sexes then what precisely is feminism should not we just have humanism or mankind ism the very word feminism demands that there be a difference between men and women even the targeting and the censorship that murphy is now experiencing finds its roots in the second wave of the feminist movement those radicals of the 60s and 70s adopted the slogan the personal is the political this comes from the title of an essay by feminist writer carole hanish the personal is the political that means that the private is the political there 's no difference between our private lives and our public obligations but that distinction however between the public and the private is essential to our liberal society the erosion of that distinction has course into the character of political activism and it 's encouraged a politics of animosity and personal destruction the trouble for the left now is that it 's set leftism on a course of radical subjectivism that prioritizes feeling over fact your truth over my truth over the truth it even justifies the censorship of opinions by redefining speech as violence which has led us to justify the censorship of triggering unsafe hateful language as a violent act megan murphy is absolutely right to acknowledge that men are not women and she 's right to fear the consequences of a politics that is so personal conservatives have long known these simple truths now the leftist feminists such as murphy faced a difficult choice do they align servants who support free speech and admit facts do not care about your feelings or do they persist with a left that would annihilate feminism altogether i am michael knowles and this is the michael knowles show [ music ] a lot to get to one of the most interesting questions facing leftist ideology right now plus we got to talk about the real story of thanksgiving but first let us make a little money honey and this is such a fitting sponsor for the day before thanksgiving blue apron,0.3373,they can not overcome trump in north carolina um they believe that they got the votes in arizona based on the predictions uh nevada could go trump 's way um pennsylvania is crazy ahead for president trump and like i told you guys if he wins nevada georgia north carolina pennsylvania is over what if he only wins georgia north carolina if he ran georgia north carolina pennsylvania um he 's going to have to win one of these he 's going to have to win one of these because arizona i do not know if arizona pushed him over he 's going to if he win boom boom boom he got to win one of these it 's that 's if he lose these two and when boom boom boom he got to win one of these and that 's what they were saying so is joe biden if joe biden wins here and here trump wins here here and here i do not think joe biden has a path to victory he would have to win both of these he can not just win one because because this well i guess they they set it up to where that could probably happen for him because if trump wins here here and here then trump only have to take one of these i think if body wins nevada arizona biden has to win both of these or win michigan and pennsylvania he 's going to have to win too if if it goes like this nevada arizona and trump wins georgia north carolina and you leave these three at play one of the two have to win two out of the three which means that donald trump has to win two out of the three or baden has to win two out of three and it does not matter which ones so if this go trump disco trump these two go biden biden has to win michigan wisconsin and michigan or wisconsin pennsylvania or michigan pennsylvania or whatever and trump has to win pennsylvania michigan or whatever case can be so it could be a uh a toss - up in that let me grab a couple of these two chests but you all this ai not this do not make sense how does anybody in america think this this,0.3216,it is also one of the big four global accounting companies offering audit consulting risk advisory tax and legal services to corporate clients with a third of a million professionals operating on those fronts worldwide and as the third largest privately owned company in the us deloitte is a beomoth with numerous and far - reaching tentacles in short it 's an entity we should all know about not least because such enterprises no longer limit themselves to their proper bailiwick profit centered business strategizing say but consciously or not have assumed the role as counselors to globalists whose policies have sparked considerable unrest around the world if you are seeking the cause of the dutch agriculture and fisheries protests the canadian trucker convoy or before that the rise of the so - called yellow jackets in france the farmer rebellion in india a few years ago the recent catastrophic collapse of sri lanka or the energy crisis in europe and australia you can instruct yourself by the recent pronouncements from deloitte while not directly responsible they offer an insight into the elite group think that has triggered these events into the cabell of centralizing globalist utopians operating in the media corporate and government fronts wielding a nightmarish vision of environmental apocalypse outlandish claims in may of this year deloitte released a clarion call to precipitous action trumpeting the climate emergency that currently confronts us called the turning point a global summary it is a stellar example of the kind of thinking characteristic of the european union 's bureaucratic overreach that generated brexit a very good decision on the part of the brits in my view and one that is now threatening the very survival of that self - same eu the report opens with two claims first that the storms wildfires droughts downpours and floods around the globe in the last 18 months are unique and unprecedented a dubious claim and implicitly that the science is now at a point where we can say without doubt that experts can and must model the entire ecology and economy of the planet and that we must modify everyone 's behavior moving forward by hooker by crook to avoid what would otherwise be the most expensive environmental and social catastrophe in history the deloitte models posit that climate impacts could affect global economic output and offer the following figures that uncheck climate change will cost us 178 trillion over the next 50 years that 's twenty five thousand dollars per person to put it in human terms who dares deny such facts stated so mathematically so precisely so scientifically let us update mark twain 's famous dictum there are lies damned lies statistics and computer models computer model does not mean data and even data does not mean fact or real world computer model means at best hypotheses posing as mathematical fact no real scientist ever says follow the science yet this is exactly what bodies such as the eu consistently pronounce pushing for collectivist solutions that often and inevitably do more harm than good solutions in sovereignty what might we rely on instead to guide us forward in these times of accelerating trouble and possibility valid authority rests in the people truly valid structures of authority are local not centralized for reasons of efficiency and emergency this must not become the generation of yet another top - down tower of babel that will not solve our problems just as similar attempts have failed to solve our problems in the past ask yourself are these deloitte models which are supposed to guide all the important decisions we make about the economic security and opportunity of families and the structures of our civil societies accurate enough even to give those who employ them any edge whatsoever say in predicting the performance of a stock portfolio one based on green energy say over the upcoming years the answer is no how do we know because if such accurate models existed and were implemented by a company with deloitte 's resources in reach deloitte would soon have all the money that is never going to happen the global economy let alone the environment is simply too complex to model it is for this reason fundamentally that we have and require a free market system the free market is the best model of the environment we can generate let me repeat that with a codicil not only is the free market the best model of the environment we can generate it is and will remain the best model that can in principle ever be generated with its widely distributed computations constituting the totality of the choices of seven billion people it simply can not be improved upon certainly not by presumptuous power mad globalist utopians who think that hiring someone mysteriously manipulating a few carefully chosen numbers and then reading the summarized output means genuine contact with the reality of the future and the generation of knowledge unassailable on both the ethical and the practical front the impact of delusional thinking why is this a problem why should you care well the savior said deloitte admit that there will be a short - term cost to implementing their cure which is by the way net zero emissions by 2050 an utterly preposterous and inexcusable goal both practically and conceptually this by the way is a goal identical to that adopted last week by the utterly delusional leaders of australia who additionally committed that resource dependent and productive country to a 40 plus decrease by 2005 standards in greenhouse gas emission within the impossible time frame of eight years this will devastate australia as the framers of such plans with their it justifies everything emergency know and even somewhat admit to knowing here is the confession couched in bureaucratic doublespeak from the deloitte consultants during the initial stages the combined cost of the upfront investments in decarbonization coupled with the already locked in damages of climate change would temporarily lower economic activity compared to the current emissions intensive path the omniscient planners then attempt to justify this with the standard empty threats and promises the suffering is certain the benefits ethereal those most exposed to the economic damages of unchecked climate change would also have the most to gain from embracing a low emissions future really tell that to the african and indian populations in the developing world lifted from poverty by coal and natural gas and think really think about this statement existing industries would be reconstitute as a series of complex interconnected emissions - free energy systems energy mobility industry manufacturing food and land use and negative emissions that sounds difficult do not you think to rebuild everything at once and better without breaking everything fixing everything in a few decades in a blindly panicked rush while demonizing anyone who dares object and what will it take to do so here 's the most alarming part nothing more than quote a coordinated transition that will require governments along with the financial services and technology sectors to catalyze facilitate and accelerate progress foster information flows across systems and align individual incentives with collective goals a clearer statement of totalitarian inclination could hardly be penned certain outcomes versus predicted outcomes the one thing the deloitte models guarantee is that if we do what they recommend we will definitely be poorer than we would have been otherwise for an indefinite but hypothetically transitory period yet any reduction in economic output however temporary and necessary will be purchased at the cost of the lives of those who are barely making it now period have you all noticed that food has become much more expensive that shelter has become much more expensive that energy is more expensive that many consumer goods are simply unavailable can you not see that this is going to get worse if the deloitte style moralists have their way how much short - term pain are you going to be required to sustain decades worth all your life and the life of your children it 's very likely for your own benefit remember that and all this painful privation is not only not going to save the planet it 's going to make it far worse i worked for a u.n subcommittee that helped prepare the 2012 report to the secretary general on sustainable development whether or not it was a good idea to contribute to such a thing is a separate issue i do believe at least that the report would have been much more harmful than it was without the input of the canadian contingent we scrubbed away several layers of globalist utopianism and cold war era conceptualization and cynicism that was something i garnered a key and crucial insight from the several years work devoted to my contribution i learned that the fastest and most certain pathway forward to the future we all want and need peaceful prosperous beautiful is through the economic elevation of the absolutely poor richer people care about the environment which is after all all that is outside the primary and fundamental concern of those desperate for their next meal make the poor rich and the planet will improve or at least get out of their way while they try to make themselves rich make the poor poorer and this is the concrete plan remember and things will get worse perhaps worse beyond imagining observe the chaos in sri lanka if you need proof there are clearly more important priorities than costly and ineffective emergency climate change reductions bjorn lombard 's work among others such as marion toopey and matt ridley has demonstrated that other pressing problems could and should take political and economic priority from the perspective of good done per dollar spent money could and should be spent for example to ensure the current health and therefore future productivity and environmental stewardship of currently poor children in developing countries for example how about attending to remediation of the actual world of pain and deprivation of such children rather than saving the hypothetical world and the hypothetical world of future children in abstraction stirrings of revolt citizens are waking up to this dutch farmers and fishermen are rising up canadian truckers are pushing back and such protests are spreading and increasing in intensity as they should why because deloitte consultants and like - minded centralists are pushing things too far it will not produce the results they are hypothetically intending this agenda justified by emergency will instead make everyone poorer particularly those who are already poor this use of emergency force will instead make the lives of the working men upon whom we all depend for our daily bread and shelter more difficult and less rewarding finally this use of emergency force will also make the environment worse not better why if you wreak your temporary economic havoc to eventually remediate the world those whom you sacrifice so casually in the attempt will descend into chaos in that chaos they will then by necessity turn their attention to matters of immediate survival and in a manner that will stress and harm the complex ecosystems and economies that can only be maintained with the long - term view that prosperity and nothing else makes possible critics of my view will say we have to accept limits to growth fine accept them personally abandoned your position of planet devouring wealthy privilege join an ascetic order graze with the cattle or if that 's too much and it probably is then purchase an electric car if you want one but no diesel - powered emergency backup vehicle or electric power generator for you buy some stock and tesla that 's probably the best bet on that front,0.2343,peter 3:21 tells you that baptism saves you not the washing away the filth of the flesh it 's not it 's not a natural thing but it 's the answering unto god of a good conscience the answering of to god 's promise to you by way of you getting baptized is how god cleanse you and release you of your sins your obedience to that is how god cleanse you first john i waited on john 3:3 chapter 3 verse 3 through 5 is where jesus talks about being born again or you can not go to heaven that 's what he says acts chapter 2 verse 38 is where the apostles are explaining what jesus taught them about repenting being born born of the water in the spirit and there 's many other scriptures if you greet the book of acts it will lead you down the right direction do not listen to people tell you this dissonant the other listen to the scripture ladies and gentlemen so those are the things that you that you want to go down the path of understand who jesus was repent be born again born of the water and and pray and you can allow people to lay hands on you that you receive the gift of the holy spirit and the gift of the holy spirit is going to follow you this god is going to going to going to fill you with your spirit and you are going to know the moment it happens do not let nobody lie to you and tell you you have the spirit just because you believe there is a moment in time where that powerful spirit hits all mortal body and you are going to react to it in the bible everybody that received the gift period begin to speak in an unknown tongue every single person in the bible there is no reasonable indication that a one would believe that they would not happen to you because the same promise to them is to you read your bible the first thing you can do if you are a you never read the bible before you are not even a christian regenesis read genesis until they get born to you after you read genesis read the gospels matthew mark luke john after reading the gospels of jesus christ read all of them read the book of acts once you finish reading those gospels the book of acts of the apostles you need to follow their instructions and then you open up access to the rest of the bible romans corinthians do not read romans and corinthians if you ai not saved if you are a christian and you believe that you are saved make sure that you were baptized make sure that you receive god 's spirit in you and you are good you are good you are good and live a holy life repent ask god for forgiveness every time you make a mistake asking for forgiveness that 's all i know that 's all i got for you guys use what i have said and you should be good you should be in the best position that you can be in ready for jesus to return all right let me finish these super check please look at tucker carson tonight i tell you that 's just probably gone forever,0.4303,okay so tonight is the next big democratic debate and the field is just a mess i mean it is an absolute mess we have had basically several people contending at the top of the field there are four top contenders right now joe biden bernie sanders still hanging around you have got elizabeth warren who is dropping fast and you have got people to judge who is climbing fast so it seems to me that elizabeth warren is in a lot of trouble it also seems to me that the romance with people who to judge is likely to peter out here there are some new national polls out today and they showed you a biden actually gaining in the national polls there 's an economist yougov poll today and has joe biden up nationally 32 22 over warren sanders at 12 boo to judge at 9 according to the hill harris poll they came out in the last couple of days is biden at 30 sanders at 18 warren at 15 boo to judge at 7 i am telling you this feels a lot like 2012 it feels a lot like 2012 on the republican side it feels like there was a front - runner everybody was unhappy with the front - runner everybody else is going to get a chance at the top everybody 's going to fall invite is going to be the nominee if you had to predict it right now that 's what i would suggest the betting odds are not reflecting that they still say that warren is the likeliest nominee but i am not seeing why that would be the case right now buta judge is leading by big numbers in both iowa and new hampshire there 's a brand new poll out in new hampshire that is devastating for elizabeth warren that is her neighboring state she has to win hey if a lizabeth warren does not win new hampshire she does not win the nomination but according to a new st . anselm poll people to judge has vaulted to a 10 - point lead over the rest of the field boo to judge 25 biden 15 warren 15 bernie sanders 9 now people would suggest here may be hardest hit is joe biden right because budaj edge is stealing sort of moderate support away from joe biden in early caucus states but that 's not correct the reason that 's not correct is because if elizabeth warren does not win in iowa or new hampshire which are super white super progressive territories how the hell do you think she 's going to perform in south carolina where one black person supports her two thirds of the electorate in south carolina on the democratic primary side of the aisle is black which is why joe biden is way up in south carolina he continues to be up 19 points in south carolina he continues to be up 9 points in nevada budi judge by the way is polling at 7 percent in nevada so buddha judge were to win both iowa and new hampshire it 's still unlikely he 's the nominee because he has no minority support as in none zero zip zilch now bernie sanders is falling out of the race but his support it seems is not bleeding over to elizabeth warren particularly and tonight the candidates on the debate stage elizabeth warren because she 's like buddha judge is in good position because he is climbing in some of the important state polls but elizabeth warren is still widely perceived by the media as the front - runner and she has opened herself up to every possible attack every plan that she has proposed is garbage she 's been shifting her plans repeatedly her wealth tax is nonsense her,0.5883,trump told ukrainian president vladimir zinsky and french president emanuel mrcon he does not support ukrainian membership in nato but he wants to see a strong well - armed ukraine emerge from any sensation of fighting that is the exact proper response okay all of this talk about donald trump is going to completely abandon ukraine to russian predations that 's not true it was never true he just says europe should take a lead since you know this is happening in europe that is not a crazy statement at all it is one thing for the united states to lend a helping hand to our allies it is another thing for us to take the lead when our allies should be doing so trump said europe should play the main role in defending and supporting ukraine and he wanted european troops present in ukraine to monitor a ceasefire he has not ruled out us support for such an arrangement even though no us troops would be involved that makes perfect sense of course and europe is immediately responding as well they should okay meanwhile a piece of breaking news courtesy of the department of justice so there are two ways to read a report that was put out by the department of justice yesterday this would be an inspector general report from michael horwitz who 's done some interesting work before at the doj there are two ways to read the report it 's all about fbi understanding and oversight with regard to january 6th one way to read the report is the way that some people in the twitter verse are reading the report which is the idea that there were lots and lots of fbi quote unquote sources in the crowd so a lot of this comes down to the definition of what a confidential human source is a confidential human source is chs according to to the justice department that is a person believed to be providing useful and credible information to the fbi and whose identity information or relationship with the fbi warrants confidential handling so the claim has been made by a lot of people on the right side of the aisle that january 6th was essentially a put - up job that it was either entrapment or that there were people who are working with or for the fbi who are encouraging people to commit criminal activity so this doj report says this quote while the fbi undertook significant efforts to identify domestic terrorism subjects who plan to travel to the capital region on january 6th and to prepare prepare to support its law enforcement partners on january 6th if needed we also determined the fbi did not take a step that could have helped the fbi and its law enforcement partners with their preparations in advance of january 6th specifically the fbi did not canvas its field offices in advance of january 6th 2021 to identify any intelligence including chs that 's confidential human source reporting about potential threats to the january 6th electoral certification several fbi officials told the oig the office of inspector general it is common practice for the fbi to ask field offices to canvas their sources for information in advance of a large event such as the inauguration super bowl or other events with significant attendance and to report that information to the requesting field office fbi deputy director paula bad who was the associate deputy director at the time described the lack of a canvas prior to january 6th as a basic step that was missed and told the oig he would have expected a formal canvasing of sources to have occurred through the issue of an intelligence collection product because it would have been the most thorough approach to understanding the threat picture prior to january 6th so in other words the fbi did not go to its field offices and ask them to canvas their confidential human sources people who say were members of the crowd on january 6th or were going to be about what they thought was going to happen on january 6th at the same time quote we found no evidence of the materials reviewed or the testimony we received showing or suggesting the fbi had undercover employees in the various protest crowds or at the capital on january 6th and so that 's been the accusations that you actually had members of the fbi like hired members of the fbi in the crowd spurring people to go into the capital the oig says we have no evidence of that we reviewed the documented chs reporting the fbi had prior to the ride and breach of the capital on january 6th 2021 we determined that three confidential human sources had been tasked by fbi fields officials in the days leading up to the january 6th electoral certification with the required approval of the wfo to travel to dc for the events of january 6th to report on domestic terrorism subjects were possibly attending the event so they had people who were effectively informers in the crowd who they had told at least three of them to go there and monitor people who are in the crowd specifically one fbi field office tasked a confidential human source to travel to dc to report on the activities of a predicated domestic terrorism subject who is separately planning to travel to dc for the january 6th electoral certification a second fbi field office tasked a confidential human source to travel to dc to potentially report on two domestic terrorism subjects from another fbi field office who were planning to travel to dc for the events of january 6th and a third confidential human source who had informed their handling agent that they intended to travel to dc on their own initiative for the events of january 6 was similarly tased by their field office to potentially report on two domestic terrorism subjects our review concluded none of these three fbi confidential human sources were authorized to enter the capital or restricted area or to otherwise break the law on january 6th nor was any chs directed by the fbi to encourage others to commit illegal acts on january 6th in addition to those three confidential human sources again this is the inspector general report we found that 23 other fbi confidential human sources were in dc on january 6th in connection with the events planned for january 6th none of these confidential human sources were authorized to enter the capital or restricted area or to otherwise break the law on january 6th,0.2934,okay meanwhile the supreme court held a big hearing yesterday on access to the abortion pill so this case is not actually about states trying to ban the abortion pill from being distributed within states that presumably will be brought up in a later supreme court case this is a different case this is a case about whether the abortion pill mone can actually be approved by the fda on an expedited schedule that is what this particular case is about according to the wall street journal the supreme court appears likely to preserve access to the abortion pill following arguments on tuesday in which justices suggested protecting doctors who oppose abortion was not enough justification to roll back access to the drug so the question here was a question of standing can doctors actually sue on their own behalf in order to reverse the decision - making process of the fda that 's the real question here several justices focus their questioning on whether doctors and medical associations that actually have standing these doctors and groups do not actually prescribe the abortion pill they do not perform abortions they have no legal obligation to help women actually perform abortions so brett kavanaugh who of course was on the correct side of overruling ro versus wade he said just to confirm under federal law no doctors be forced against their consciences to perform or assist in an abortion correct and the solicitor general for the government elizabeth progar she said yes we think the federal conscience protections provide broad coverage here so again these doctors were suing saying that there might be an emergency that arises from the fda 's decision to greenlight the abortion pill on an expedited schedule that might lead to further emergency situations in which doctors because of emergency law are forced to actually deal with the aftermath of the abortion pill gone wrong and the justice are saying well that 's a bit of a stretch you are not talking about a contingency based on a contingency the alliance defending freedom which is an excellent group they brought this case on behalf of doctors and medical associations that oppose abortion because these pills can be sent through the mail and then self - administered anti - abortion groups fear that m prisone can help women flout abortion laws in various states ain holly who 's josh h 's wife the senator she 's a lawyer for the adf she won a lower court ruling reimposing restrictions on m fipr stone that had been in place from 2000 when the fda first approved the drug to 2016 that is when the agency said that research said that the rules could safely be relaxed and so the question was whether this was a violation of the fda rule whether a court could review that based on a lawsuit brought by doctors and medical associations this case is really more about legal standing to sue as opposed to whether say a state could ban the importation of mif stone into the actual state justice gorsuch questioned why the case should affect anyone other than the doctors involved he said this case seems like a prime example of turning what could be a small lawsuit into a nationwide legislative assembly on an fda rule holly said it would be impracticable to limit a court order to protecting the individual plaintiffs the unpredictable nature of emergency room workk meant that doctors would still risk encouraging encountering rather a mone patient so again this happens to be a fairly weak case justice samuel alo who wrote the original opinion obviously in dos overturning r versus wade questioned whether the fda deserved the kind of difference it was being granted he asked if the fda had ever approved a drug and then pulled it after discovering safety problems lawyers for the agency said that both the agency and the manufacturer monitor the drug use and would take action if risks emerged and then justice katangi brown jackson said you asked if the agency is infallible i am wondering about the flip side which is you think courts have specialized scientific knowledge with respect to pharmaceuticals again there are kind of two issues one is if the fda explicitly for political reasons fast tracks a drug like in abortion bill can that be sued upon or is the fda basically ironclad alo is right on that particular issue the fda 's decisions should not be ironclad and it should be subject to questions as to whether the fda actually went through its properly prescribed process where they can shortcut their own process the standing question is a different issue and the standing question it seems like these doctors have a fairly weak case and so in all likelihood the the current fda regulations will be upheld not on the grounds that the fda regulations are particularly good but on the grounds of standing i understand that 's a little bit legally specific but that is in fact what the case is it is not about broadening quote unquote abortion rights which is the way the media are going to treat it meanwhile the city of new york continues to grapple with massive crime according to the new york times in one evening barely an hour apart mayor eric adams has been confronted with two tragic events that crystallized some people 's persistent fears about new york city shortly before the mayor announced the shooting death of police officer jonathan diller from a hospital in queens the police confirmed a man had been fatally pushed into the path of a subway train in an unprovoked attack in manhattan the two episodes underscored the defining challenge of mr adams 's mayor aly as he has tried to improve public safety and boost the city 's recovery from covid in recent months he has said crime is down jobs are up to drive his point home but violence on monday undercut that argument that the city is becoming less dangerous adams found himself in a familiar place on monday night grieving with new yorkers over another senseless act of violence and again the reality is if you do not want this to happen you need more more police officers on the street and you need to unshackle those police officers to actually deal with criminals you need to bring back things like yes stop and frisk and broken windows theory the fact that new york got away from this after two decades of tamping down its crime problem is an absolutely astonishing lesson in the fact that humanity has a short - term memory of a guppy it really is an incredible thing all of humanity apparently has the memory span of dory from finding nemo so you will have a complete a complete destruction of a major american city like new york city from the 1960s all the way until the early 90s,0.7778,the situation seems destined to result in even deadlier and more protect protracted slog wreaking devastation in ukraine causing a massive humanitarian crisis as the war enters its third week president biden and his team are also entering a murkier more difficult stage of the conflict or the new challenge is how to control the largely uncontrollable vladimir putin and his endgame whatever that may be the bind administration has successfully encouraged nato and other western allies to use nearly every available lever of power to punish putin those efforts so far have had little discernible influence over the russian president who has only escalated his military offensive on cities and towns across ukraine any outcome represents a lose - lose proposition as even an eventual russian defeat is likely to leave ukraine decimated and its european neighbors bearing the brunt of the humanitarian crisis so far the u.n human rights office reports 516 civilians in ukraine have been killed since february 24th adding the actual total is probably much higher a senior u.s military official said yesterday that at least 4 000 russian troops may have died at this point as well a european diplomats had the longer this goes on the likelier it will be that russia ends up being defeated but also more likely that more people will die jim townsend former deputy assistant secretary of defense for european and nato policy said right now everyone is kind of feeling their way forward he said the end game is going to be pretty complicated the endgame is going to have to deal with putin as he is it 's also going to have to deal with ukraine getting back on his feet and deal with what to do with those sanctions the current us strategy is to ensure the economic cost for russia are severe and sustainable as well as to continue supporting ukraine militarily in its effort to inflict as many defeats on russia as possible but u.s military assistance remains limited and herein lies the problem if the idea is you ratchet up the pressure so that putin knows that this is basically a lost war and it 's going nowhere so come to the table and we will hammer something out you need to not be scared of shipping in the military material necessary in order to fight the russians to a standoff the bind administration is not doing this u.s officials right there right now say they are no rush to directly engage putin anthony blinken told reporters it 's important to remember throughout this crisis created by putin we have sought to provide possible off - ramps to putin he 's the only one who can decide whether or not to take them so far every time there 's been an opportunity to do just that he 's pressed the accelerator and continued down this horrific road that he has been pursuing blinken added the bite administration ultimately expects a strategic defeat of putin and russia despite any short - term tactical gains it may make in ukraine and blink and said we will accomplish this by backing ukrainians in their fight by remaining united and holding russia accountable he said we have already seen russia 's failed at its chief objectives it 's not able to hold ukraine it 's not going to be able to hold ukraine in the long term no matter what tactical victories they achieve in the near term a senior state department official said there are a few indications the russians are in any mood for serious diplomacy at this point but some analysts warn that the biden administration does not have the luxury of sitting back and allowing others to negotiate with moscow jeremy shapiro no relation research director at the european council on foreign relations says the russians are not going to make concessions when they sit across the table from french turks israelis or ukrainians shapiro said the advantage of negotiate peace has that it can limit the violence so right now the question is what ukraine thinks is ukraine going to keep this going indefinitely in the hopes that russia just pulls out or are they likely to negotiate some sort of exit strategies here 's the thing the western position is the longer this goes on the worse it is for russia but the longer this goes on the worse it is for nato if putin senses cracks in nato if putin senses that there is no long - term plan here and that he actually has the whip hand with regards to for example european energy in the long term if he senses that the west is so scared of his nuclear threats that we will not do what we need to do in order to re - arm ukraine then he 's just going to keep going with this the only way this stops is if he feels that the west can do this indefinitely and he can not right now that 's the question and the opposite may in fact be true so for example the german ambassador yesterday emily haber she said it 's possible to function like today but it 's not going to be possible to function without russian oil and natural gas maybe even a couple of weeks from now is it possible for europe to function without russian oil and gas it is at great costs that will not be containable um and it will be possible to function but uh not uh today not tomorrow,0.6385,she 's up 47 to 45 however the margin of error is plus or minus 2 and a half percentage points and remember when they say that the margin eror is two and a half percentage points they mean that if kla harris is at 47 % she could be at 49.5 and she could also be at 44.5 so in other words you have no idea who 's leading this race this thing is a dead heat it also happens to be the case that we are in a dead heat in all of the major swing states at this point and that now has expanded to include places like north carolina and georgia so we have a dead heat we have not yet had a debate between kla harris and donald trump and there 's been a hue and cry from people like me for 40 days that kla harris has answered zero difficult questions so last night at long last she finally sat down and are we going to are we going to move see here 's the thing about that interview dana bash who 's the interviewer for cnn did a horrifyingly bad job she would ask a somewhat difficult question to kl harris and then kl harris would wriggle her way out of the question and then danana bash would be one question away from just poke her and kla harris could have been flying off the cliff because the thing she was saying made no sense one little pr and kam harris is a is a bug on the windshield somewhere danab bash knew that so she was not going to do that so instead she started feeding her answers she started avoiding the follow - ups that would have hurt her so dana bash did not do her job last night that is not a giant shock also worth noting this interview was a grand total of 26 minutes 27 minutes k harris talked for 16 of them one 16 - minute interview is not going to do it it is not going to do it for k harris not only that the esthetics of the interview were awful you just put up a screen cap of the interview any of these clips just any any screen cap from all three of them please there we go so here you can see what this interview looked like it looks like trash apparently they did this in a cafe they wanted to do it with people sitting around but the problem was they had safety protocols so they could not do that so instead they emptied out the cafe so as my friend matt walsh says they looked like they were doing this from the inside of a small town airport waiting because there was a flight delay not only that this thing was staged poorly tim walls is taller than kla harris she 's not a very tall woman she looks like he has brought her to the principal 's office that 's what he looks like i tweeted out that it looks like she brought her dad to the mcdonald 's interview that 's what this image looks like it is a bad look it is poorly lit it is dark it is weirdly drained of all color so it looks almost grayscale this interview because of the lighting tim wall is in the foreground kla harris is in the background which makes her look even smaller than she normally is and you got dana bashan profile,0.4804,so we have people who are pro bitcoin and we have people who are anti bitcoin on the pro bitcoin side of course you have elon musk very very pro bitcoin you have the winklevosses they are very pro bitcoin on the con side you have people like peter schiff he 's very con on bitcoin you have michael berry from the big short he is very con on bitcoin to explain what bitcoin is first you sort of have to understand what money itself is now i know what you are thinking well it 's it 's right here in my wallet that 's what money is yes that 's what a physical dollar is but what exactly is money supposed to do so from the earliest times people have found a way to convey value to one another in pieces of exchange that are not actually the items of exchange let us say that you have this guy and this guy loves oranges he grows oranges for a living right that 's what he grows and he wants to trade with this guy and this guy grows apples for a living,0.6725,tucker carlson is back yesterday he posted this video on twitter making a major announcement and apparently violating his fox news contract that 's going to cost him millions and millions of dollars so even if you have heard the big news stay tuned because i will get into all the details i will show you the freak out of the mainstream media and brian stelter is going to weigh in no pun intended as well you can not have a free society if people are not allowed to say what they think is true speech is the fundamental prerequisite for democracy that 's why it 's enshrined in the first of our constitutional amendments amazingly as of tonight there are not many platforms left that allow free speech the last big one remaining in the world the only one is twitter where we are now starting soon we will be bringing a new version of the show we have been doing for the last six and a half years to twitter we bring some other things too which we will tell you about but for now we are just grateful to be here free speech is the main right that you have without it you have no others see you soon as you can imagine the liberal media is not very happy about this cnn reports that right - wing extremist tucker carlson will relaunch his program on twitter when i first saw a screenshot of this floating around social media i thought maybe that 's a meme but then on the other hand cnn is that crazy to actually call him a right - wing extremist so being your trusted media analyst i double checked and went directly to the source and it 's real and this is also true from the satire news website the babylon b which says unemployed guys basement selfie video crushes fox news and prime time ratings referring to his previous statement that he made last week and it 's still true because his latest video making the big announcement of his imminent return has over 7 million views which is over double the viewership of his former fox news primetime show and contrary to popular belief fox news technically has not fired tucker they just cancel the show he still is getting paid by the network he 's still under contract by the network and we will be under contract until he finally negotiates exit until january of 2025 which means that fox news is trying to keep him muzzled and off of any competing network we are off from doing any other shows anywhere else through the entire election cycle so he either has breached his contract or is basically just testing the water uh in order to use it as leverage to negotiate his exit so that they will finally let him go the new york times says tucker carlson 's still under contract that fox says he will start a show on twitter his clan made on twitter suggests that his negotiations to reach an amicable separation with the network had broken down this clown who used to work for cnn but now works for some no - name news network says that tucker will forego at least 25 million dollars owed to him by fox in order to break his non - compete clause and while that is an unfathomable amount of money for us normal people not the tucker is abnormal but he 's in a league of his own the that is only about one year 's salary for what fox news was paying him and tucker is already from what i understand independently wealthy he inherited a bunch of money from his father so for him it does not even matter and tucker 's attorney has broken his silence accusing fox news of fraud and breach of contract so there are definitely some tense negotiations going on behind the scenes to get tucker free from those golden handcuffs and not many people outside of the business know this but me being your trusted media analyst i tell you how the machine actually functions behind the scenes but every single contract between a news agency and one of their reporters or on their personalities talk show host have what 's called an arbitration clause which means that if there is some legal dispute between either of the two parties that is settled privately in what 's called arbitration which is done by accredited judges and everything but it 's behind the scenes in normal lawsuits are done in public and everything that 's filed is part of the public record but in order to prevent their dirty laundry from airing out in public every single news agency the fake news agency includes arbitration arbitration clauses in their contracts so we are not going to know know exactly what the details are between these negotiations other than what tucker carlson 's lawyer reveals elon musk revealed that tucker has not signed any sort of a deal with him he 's just going to launch his show on twitter and tucker may end up doing ad reads like virtually every other talk show host and youtuber or he might just use the new subscriber function which twitter has recently launched where people can basically subscribe for exclusive content on the platform now this is going to be both good and a little bad tucker 's going to be able to say whatever he wants he 's going to be able to interview whoever he wants he 's not going to have any corporate controllers telling him what he can and can not say or do and with elon musk loosening the terms of service he 's going to be able to say anything he wants to without having his account penalized suspended or banned but at the same time tucker 's going to lose a significant portion of his older viewers the typical fox news viewer who believe it or not their average age is in their 70s and no disrespect to the baby boomers but many of them are not all that tech savvy i know,0.1778,so here is some good news there is actual good news coming so pfizer now says their vaccine is 95 effective in their final data they are going to seek authorization from the fba fda emergency authorization as of like right now according to the wall street journal an experimental cova 19 vaccine from pfizer and bio entec was 95 effective in final results from a pivotal study and showing signs of being safe key pieces of data as the companies prepare to ask health regulates health regulators to authorize use pfizer plans to seek authorization for that vaccine within days the company said wednesday leaving the shot on track to go into distribution by the end of the year if health regulators permit now it 's true that tens of millions of people will not be able to get the doses but tens of millions of people may not need the doses if you start with the most vulnerable my kids do not need doses of the vaccine i do not need a dose of the vaccine right the death rates on people who are under the age of 70 are pretty scanty particularly if you have no pre - existing conditions it 's something like five and one thousand are the death rates on people who are under the age of 70 in the united states and that includes people with pre - existing conditions so if you are in good health and you are 30 you probably do not need the vaccine right away in order for everybody to sort of start getting back to normal life the 95 effectiveness rate puts the shot 's performance on power with shingles and measles which is really damned effective it 's also consistent with the vaccine showing in a peak last week and how it did in an analysis of the first 94 subjects to fall sick researchers have not yet found any serious safety issues the vaccine appears to be well tolerated following a review from 8 000 study subjects a severe side effect was fatigue that was reported by about four percent of the subjects about two percent of subjects reported headaches but that 's not like gm bar syndrome or something the company said they have collected two months of safety data on about 19 000 study subjects requested by the fda they are still reviewing all of those results earlier moderna reported a similarly strong preliminary result for its shot which the biotech said was 94.5 effective in an early look studies show that a lot of people are hesitant to get the shots the evidence suggests that that hesitancy is uh probably not worthwhile at this point a committee of independent health experts has analyzed the data from the trial and reported the results to pfizer and bio and tech the companies released the data by press release and they plan to publish the results in more detail later in a peer - reviewed medical journal the fda is expected to take some time to consider the request for permission to distribute the vaccine that will require a review by an outside committee of vaccine experts the fda plans to expedite the review obviously during the pandemic the fda has authorized emergency use for several drugs including rem desevier and recently a coveted 19 antibody drug from eli lilly and company upon authorization pfizer plans to produce up to 50 million doses by the end of the year about half of which would be destined for the united states the supplies would be enough to inoculate about 12.5 million americans because each person needs to take two doses three weeks apart now again that 's a great start i mean if you start with people who are the most vulnerable people in nursing homes people with significant pre - existing conditions there are tens of millions of those people but if you start with healthcare workers for example and you start with the people who are most likely to die namely people who are above the age of 70 with pre - existing conditions well you are going to bring down those death rates pretty significantly and pretty quickly so that is excellent excellent news and more excellent news it turns out immunity to coronavirus could last for a year according to apoorva mandeville reporting from the new york times years maybe even decades immunity might last eight months after infection most people who have recovered still have enough immune cells to fend off the virus and prevent illness according to new data a slow rate of decline in the short term suggests that these cells may persist in the body for a very very long time to come the research published online has not been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal it is the most comprehensive and long - ranging study of immune memory to the chromovirus to date now this does show how irresponsible the media are remember the media found like one case all over the world of a guy who was reinfected with covet,0.5142,they are angry mostly that florida is thriving while they live in gray dreary cities covered in human feces and used heroin needles so you can hardly blame them for being a bit envious but the professed reason for all the anger towards florida this time in recent days has been our particular piece of legislation called the parental rights and education bill now even if you do not live in the state it 's worth tracking the story because much can be learned from it i think and especially from the reaction to this bill so the law would bar schools from discussing sexual orientation and gender identity with kids in elementary school and this has provoked volcanic fury from the left to have dubbed the legislation the do not say gay bill they claim that this is among other things an attack on free speech of course the idea that adults have the free speech right to have inappropriate sexual conversations with children is the kind of thing that you 'd expect only pedophiles and perverts and predators to argue for and you would be right and it 's easy enough to understand why gender identity should not be discussed in elementary school in fact it should not be discussed in any grade any at any level because it 's an incoherent made - up concept invented not coincidentally by a pedophile mad scientist named john money who you are well familiar with if you listen to this show gender identity is a religious doctrine it 's part of the left - wing creed it has no basis in science or reality now if a christian public school teacher can not stand in front of his class and declare that jesus christ is lord and savior and all students should accept him into their hearts then a leftist public school teacher should not be able to stand in front of his class and declare that boys can magically become girls if they believe it in their hearts the left has for years shouted that we must keep religion out of the classrooms but as it turns out they only had certain religions in mind which we have known for a while but what about sexual orientation now it 's at least coherence and factually true to say that a person has sexual urges which are generally oriented one way or another in fact um john money also coined the term sexual orientation but at least in this case there 's it 's it 's it 's coherent you understand what 's being said the question though is whether a government employee in the government education system would ever have any valid reason to talk to a nine - year - old about sexual urges the answer to that question obviously is no the left says that not only do these adults have good reason to talk about sexual urges with prepubescent children but even that they the adults have a right to hold such discussions to force them to refrain from talking about their sexual urges with children is to persecute them we are told moreover it deprives the children of something that they need because children before the age of puberty somehow need to talk about a topic that they fundamentally will not be able to understand and which has nothing to do with any of the academic subjects that they are going to school to learn about this is absurd for a lot of reasons but the main one is that it goes the other way around you are not depriving children of something they need by refraining from having inappropriate sexual conversations with them in elementary school you are depriving them of something you they need when you do have those conversations namely you are depriving them of the innocence of childhood now leftists they they actually will openly scoff at the very idea of the innocence of childhood they do not recognize that there is not any innocent child because along with being acolytes of john money even if they do not know their acolytes of them they are also acolytes of alfred kinsey and the other late 19th and early 20th century degenerates who claim that children are sexual from birth now that 's false but it turns out this was not a that this was not a description it was a prescription children are not naturally sexual from birth but these quacks would try to change that they wanted them to be and they have been trying to change that fact ever since and to prevent them from doing so to prevent the adults from doing that from sexualizing childhood that is a personal attack against them we are told which should really tell you something and so should this outrage was renewed over the weekend after a new amendment was added to the bill which according to all the headlines would require schools to quote out their students now the idea of outing an elementary school student does not even really make any sense to begin with but the way the headlines are written it makes it sound like teachers are required to investigate a child 's sexual preferences and then set off some kind of alarm you know pull an alarm and alert the whole building if a kid turns out to be gay yet investigating sexual preferences is exactly the sort of thing that the bill forbids that 's what they are not supposed to be doing so the framing does not really make any sense here it turns out when critics say outing what they mean is that schools are required to inform parents and there 's a difference there so here 's the article from the hill it says a new amendment to florida 's do not say gay bill would require schools to inform parents of their children 's sexual orientation within six weeks of learning that the student is not straight nbc affiliate wfla reported on monday the amendment was filed friday by the bill 's co - sponsor state representative joe harding the bill which has gained national attention and pushed back bars educators in florida from talking about sexual orientation or gender identity in primary schools parents would be able to take legal action against school districts that they believe have violated the measure the original version of the legislation required schools to inform families of their child 's lgbtq plus status but gave an option for exemption for the outing in cases where educators feared it could lead to abuse neglect or abandonment the amendment offers no such exception,0.5435,so all this raises the question and there 's a lot of focus in the media always on mass shootings mass shootings represent a fraction of the homicides with guns that happen in this nation and whenever you see statistics about how they have been like 200 300 mass shootings a year in the united states that is a definitional question so what they mean by this is any shooting that includes two or more people they will now classify as a mastering but that 's not what they are trying to do is play a semantic game with you when you think of a mass shooting you think of like something that just happened in louisville or you think of the trans man who shot up a bunch of christian school kids at a school near nashville tennessee that 's what you think when you think mass shooting then they say there are like 300 of these a year they are like whoa i do not even realize they are that they are earned okay the sort of spectacular six seven eight victim mass shootings and more that you see there 's maybe six or seven of those a year like at sort of top of the funnel now again every one of those in active evil and we should do what we can to prevent those things but when they say that there 's like 200 300 a year what they mean by that is basically gang violence they are looking at gang members who are shooting each other and then they are reclassifying those as mass shootings for purposes of driving the notion that the thing we have to do is crack down on shootings like the one that happened in louisville or nashville more than the overall problem of gun homicide because if they focus in on the overall problem of gun homicide you find very quickly exactly where this is happening the answer is big blue cities big blue cities is where most of the gun homicide is happening in the united states and not only that it is happening centrally located in neighborhoods that have a disproportionately black population now again that has nothing to do with the inherent qualities of race or anything like that that is just a statistical fact and that 's an uncomfortable conversation that nobody on the left wants to have because if you point out that vermont has lots of guns and virtually no gun crime and that chicago has lots of guns and tons of gun crime it might suggest that the problem actually is not either race or guns the problem is the societal structures that incentivize crime in these various areas and that might implicate you know some of the actual governance in these areas if you focus in on chicago or you folks in washington dc you focus in on the baltimore 's of the world then that might require very different solutions because you look at those places those believe in government democrats for pretty much all of time and i have noticed a problem there which is that virtually all of the murder in the united states is happening in cities like those ones and you can see this in the stats so pew research came out with a study just last week in which they pointed out that the number of children and teens killed by gunfire in the united states increased 50 percent between 2019 and 2021 that 's a shocking statistic by 50 the number of kids and teens killed by gunfire now the biden administration the media their take on that is that 's because republicans are evil and want kids to die in mass school shootings but here 's the reality the vast majority of children and teens who are being killed in shootings are not being killed in schools by mass shooters obviously they are being killed in neighborhoods where people are shooting at people in 2019 before the coveted pandemic there were 1 732 gun deaths among us kids aged under the age of 18 .,0.5641
and there 's um you know kind of scary vibe towards you know selfishness and greed you know we have green does one be a pain on society you know people are going to care about each other just going to look just for each other over the thing is the most you know the most benefit that society has ever gained from what i believe is the best economic system in the world or in humanities history cable ism the best the most benefits and most useful application we received from this system have come about from greed it 's come about from people pursuing their own self - interest doing what they want to do so they get the result that they want to see and i do not think that 's a bad thing you know the baker you know who bakes who bakes cakes you know he 's doing what he wants to do he wants to see you know um i guess more like if it 's a wedding bakery more weddings and he wants to contribute a so he wants to you know pursue that and he wants to contribute to you know getting getting paid or maybe he just wants to increase the devisor marriage that 's fine that may be beneficial society and we appreciate his service because obviously if he 's employed people are buying his product then we appreciate it same thing with things like um like charity you know people do not give the charity just because they are selfless just know no one in the world is selfless,0.1082,so the idea that this movement does he anti - establishment movement started with trump is just nonsense trump was just the latest generation of that movement remember we have had these battles going on for a long time dave brat and eric cantor christine o'donnell and mike castle in delaware right these sorts of swings against the establishment have been going on since 2009 - 2010 and trump was just a cork bobbing on the waves of that movement he was not the leader of that movement and last night 's election showed that because it showed that trump does not have coattails trump tried to pull luthor strange over the finish line so much so that this morning trump would tweeted a bunch of times you are a big luthor he actually went back and deleted the tweets which i mean president trump that 's not how twitter works you deleting the tweets actually draws more attention to your old tweets just silly but because president trump was campaigning for strange people see this as a slap in the face to trump really is not a slap in the face to trump it 's just that trump is not the most important thing about this movement this movement pre - existed trump and will exist long after trump it 's more about mcconnell people do not like mcconnell people do not like the establishment strange was identified as somebody identified with mcconnell even though he really should not have been he voted with from 92 % of the time roy moore campaigned hard against mcconnell and that made a lot of difference so this means that trump as an individual figure is not that important except there 's a litmus test for loyalty and it means that trumpism is not actually a movement trumpism is incoherent because if trump is not meant anything it would mean follow trump against bannon abandoned basically said i defend trumpism against trump which means that trump is really just a symbol but roy moore is not a trump as to per se roy moore is a guy who does not even believe in judicial supremacy i mean roy moore is a pretty fundamentalist conservative christian which is not trump 's exact brand all this is to say that i think that there has been people have gotten a little carried away with it with the trumpet by a little carried away i mean a lot carried away not every battle is about trump it 's not the trump lost in alabama last night it 's that the establishment lost in alabama last night or the perceived establishment lost and that 's been going on since 2010 this was not the beginning of something new this is not a new rift inside trumpism this is the same movement that 's been going on for seven years now and it is continuing through the selection cycle so forget about trump forget about ban and they are not really important the question is establishment versus anti - establishment that 's all that 's all it 's going to make things tough for mcconnell so mcconnell has a fractious caucus already right he has a caucus that is not doing what he wants it to do he could not get health care reform passed he 's going to have a tough time with tax reform they have not been able to build the wall he 's basically gotten nothing done mitch mcconnell,0.36,but they are also rooted in dishonesty because their fundamental ideology is just a dishonest ideology there 's a tweet that came out not from the biden administration but is indicative of how the biden administration thinks about policy we have talked about the equity ideology of the biden administration before they have said over and over and over again that every element of this administration is going to be shot through with equity and equity of course is just a euphemism for racial preference because the fact of the matter is that equality is about whether we all are being given access to individual rights protected by government and pre - existing government that is what equality is about equity is about the idea that if two groups have unequal outcomes this must be because of some systemic prejudice this must be because of something in the system that is bad and what this does is it removes individual responsibility if you live in a free system and you are given equal rights your rights are protected by the government like you have the right to life you have the right to liberty you have the right to keep and bear arms you have the right to freedom of the press and freedom of religion if all those rights are protected and then you end up unsuccessful in a free country then the baseline notion for most rational people would be maybe your personal actions had something to do with your level of unsuccess maybe your choices had something to do with where you ended up but for the left those choices do not matter at all because you have to understand that in marxist theory virtually all human choices are shaped by the systems in which we live that 's why marx suggested that all of the problems in western society were created by capitalism all we would have to do is shift the systems in which we live and this would mold the brand new humanity in which everyone would be able to succeed along the lines they saw fit without regard to the kinds of choices they were making they would simply stop making bad choices because those bad choices are the product of the system now what this does is it removes individual responsibility from people now when you take this to the racial sphere when you start suggesting that people are not responsible for their individual actions based on race you sound like a white supremacist and the fact is that much of the ideology of vocaism much of the ideology of equity sounds exactly like the ideology of david duke the idea that black people are incapable of making free and independent decisions and therefore any bad decision that is made by black americans is to be attributed to the system at large this sounds like a removal of agency from black people that is not only inappropriate it is racist in and of itself because as it turns out black people are the same as everyone people of every other color we are all capable of making individual decisions and we are all responsible for the individual decisions we make but the left 's equity ideology is rooted in that fundamental lie which is that certain types of people in america are not responsible for their personal decisions so eugene goo who is this stanford trained doctor and of course was a big push he was a big pusher of sort of cove with lockdown very woke guy he tweeted this out the other day and i thought that this is this is so indicative of how so much of the left things because it is mainstream left - wing thought at this point he tweeted out black on asian crimes only occur because of our system of white supremacy that strips african - americans of their economic opportunities while taking respect and dignity away from asian americans also white people empower our experts at dividing and conquering to stay in power so presumably he was speaking about this case that we discussed yesterday on the program in new york city where a man beat the living hell out of an asian woman on the street and it turns out that this particular man happened to be a black man and that frankly is not supremely surprising in new york city because as it turns out a disproportionate number of people who have been victimizing asian american people are young black people so eugene goose solution to this his explanation of this is that black people have no agency black people are not capable of making decisions you see and because black people are not capable of making decisions all of america 's structures must be changed so as to make all outcomes equivalent equal rights no longer matter we are going to have to make decisions for you we are going to be paternalistic we are going to make decisions for you so that your outcome is equivalent to everybody else 's outcome and if you do something wrong we are simply going to relieve you of the responsibility this sounds like david duke except in reverse right david duke says that black people have no agency because black people are inferior the wokest say black people have no agency because black people are inferior because white people have made them inferior how about this black people are not inferior how about black people are just the same as every other other individuals in american life they are just as responsible for their own individual decisions they are just as capable of success they are just as capable as it turns out of not beating up asian americans on the street and thus if an individual person beats up an asian american no matter the race that person should be held fully responsible for their level of hatred and by the way his entire argument eugene goo here that black on nation crimes only occur because of white supremacy is utterly insane on its face it 's crazy it turns out that the man who was busted now for the attack on this asian american woman is named brandon elliott,0.1728,"you are going to take police from single moms vulnerable children domestic violence victims the people who need them the most you are robbing them and you should be ashamed of yourself my name is brendon tatum i need six and a half years on the police department and i did just about everything you can imagine i was on the swat team i was a field training officer meaning i trained new officers how to become officers and i was involved in almost every aspect of the police department it 's all you will not lift this out there let me give you a reality check there are dangerous evil people in this world and when that dangerous evil person comes to your front door forced entry into your house with your children there who are you going to call you are not going to call the politicians you are not going to call the activists who are out here defunding the police you are going to call a man or a woman who 's sworn to uphold the law wearing a badge they are not going to be cowardice they are not going to turn away from you because of your race or because of what you look like or because of your past mistakes they are going to come into your house and they are going to protect you with their whole life no matter what the consequences are no matter if they never come home to see their family they are going to be there for you i made $ 40,000 a year i do not do it for the money i did it because i love my community you could not pay me enough to put my life on the line you can not pay me enough to have to worry about not coming home every night to my children you owe it to america to explain what part of the police department you plan on cutting are you going to cut the domestic violence unit are you going to cut the individuals who investigate child sex crimes internet crimes elder abuse are you going to cut the swat team some of the best trained men and women in the entire world who do you think is going to handle the terrorist attacks on american soil who do you think is going to stop the drug dealers from dealing drugs to your children who 's going to do that for you you guys are not equipped to do that that 's why you have police officers that go through the training are you have you ever been to academy do you know what we learned do you know the sacrifices that are made do you know how much we spend time learning about the laws learning about the constitution learning about how to deescalate learning about crisis intervention about mental health crisis learning how to drive how to shoot it 's your fault that people are out here killing police house for no reason ambushing police officers the hatred and vitriol for really good people you are creating that animosity that should not exist you are putting a target on our backs you are making it unsafe for us to go to work what do you think you are doing to the morale do you think it 's exciting for a police officer to go to work why would anybody want to be a police officer right now why the good men and women who are training who are educated who have had a passion since the day that they were born to be a servant is going to turn this job away i want you to understand this policing in america is not just a job it 's a calling and there are people who answer the call on a day - to - day basis why are you trying to destroy that dream why are you trying to distract and deter people from answering the calling on their life and you are doing it for political gain and all of these fraudulent politicians and celebrities yelling at you telling you you should define the police guess what they have armed security people that are there to protect them 24 hours a day they have guns you do not and it breaks my heart to see a man of integrity served on the police department for 38 years served honorably serve the community was a leader lost his life and what do ya'll say nothing nothing you should be thinking about defining the criminal element in the community you guys are focused in the wrong area we all understand policing and that we can all improve i would love to see police officers have the availability to have more training more exposure that comes with more funding not defunding let me tell you what needs to be defunded these failed government programs that have done nothing for young people in the inner - city not provided opportunities have not provided education they have done nothing the funding of the police department is where you see success a well - funded police department with good adequate training that 's what 's going to protect these people that 's what 's going to keep people safe that 's what 's going to get the guns off of the streets that 's going to give young people an opportunity to flourish to live their dreams to accomplish things without getting snuffed out through gang violence through drugs through homicides come on man it 's common sense but you are not operating on common sense you are operating on the emotions you are operating on political correctness you operating on mob rule",0.5547,very few schools are closing go back and read what i said i do not over promise and but i have probably uh outperformed what anybody thought would happen why do you suppose such large segments of the american electorate have come to harbor such profound concerns about your cognitive fitness thank you i have no idea joe biden marked his first year in office with a press conference that went viral for how terrible it was as one old saying goes you can tell a politician is lying when his mouth is moving and without a doubt embellishing one 's feats and downplaying one 's faults comes part and parcel withholding elected office joe biden 's first year as commander - in - chief had its fill of scandals controversies and missteps there 's out - of - control immigration from latin america the disastrous afghanistan withdrawal and the increasing boldness of china and russia and that 's just foreign policy at home we have had runaway inflation high gas prices empty shelves due to the supply chain crisis a sluggish return to the workforce and hundreds of thousands of new covert cases biden has come by his abysmal approval ratings honestly which are now dropping like a rock towards the low 30s because right now polls show almost two - thirds of americans think the united states is on the wrong track that is the second worst percentage since they started tracking it during jimmy carter 's presidency and a recent quinnipiac poll showed only 25 percent of independents approve of biden 's job as president but as this administration concluded its first year president joe biden shuffled out from the oval office to participate in a two - hour long press conference he did his best to portray the missteps through rose - colored aviator glasses when they were mentioned but as reporters got to offer some pushback the presser devolved from uneasy propaganda to a series of gaffes awkward silences and sarcastic snappy remarks in a way it 's hard to make sense of it all but here are some of the most notable and chaotic moments i often see empty shells being shown on television 89 percent are full which is only a few points below what it was before the pandemic while biden was trying to take credit for saving christmas he highlighted a scene that many americans across the country have been experiencing including in washington dc empty shelves he tried to downplay the supply crisis by claiming that store shelves are only a little bit more empty than they were at the start of the pandemic oddly biden suggests that it 's a win for his administration that stores are now struggling to keep items stocked just like they were back in 2020 and on top of that he noted another achievement of the biden administration the price of food if you can find it it 's through the roof like i said you have a circumstance where people are paying more for a pound of hamburger meat than they ever paid we turned now to food manufacturers across the country announcing a new round of price increases coming to consumers in 2022 the price of milk 4.6 higher than a year ago bred four percent poultry fish and eggs 13 higher president biden also stood by his disastrous afghanistan pull - out now to be fair afghanistan was a mess long before biden was in the white house as the years went on the missions seemed to move from fighting al - qaeda toward building a nation - state from scratch over the course of two decades the united states spent 2.3 trillion dollars on a conflict that resulted in 241 000 deaths but thanks to biden the last days of the war added insult to injury the afghan military immediately surrendered to the taliban after the u.s withdrawal the billions and billions of dollars spent training and arming the afghans was apparently wasted as american forces tried desperately to hold on to the kabul airport for the final withdrawal a terrorist who was just free from prison during the retreat carried out a suicide attack that killed 13 u.s service members soon after the u.s launched a drone strike that managed to kill 10 civilians including seven children the administration denied for weeks that the strike was a massive mistake and once they did admit the error no one was held accountable what was biden 's response during the press conference well apparently he makes no apologies for the retreat and i make no apologies for what i did i have a great concern for the women and men who were blown up on the line at the airport by a terrorist attack against them biden also appeared to make no apologies during the dignified transfer of the 13 service members who died even taking a not so subtle glance at his watch during the ceremony that do not happen just once that happened on every single one that came out of that airplane it happened on every single one of them every american knows that in his old age president biden is not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed when he 's speaking in public for more than a few minutes he ends up displaying some strange behavior or making some awkward comments and cornpop was a bad dude or stroking a small child or snapping at a voter do not know what you said i will get your work straight jack really anything could happen through the campaign season and during the past year however those in biden 's circle have done their best to downplay the obvious first lady jill biden called the suggestion that biden 's mental fitness has declined ridiculous and during the press conference biden followed suit saying that he has no idea why half of americans do not agree with the notion that he is mentally fit before quickly moving on to the next question why do you

elections the for the people act for instance would eliminate voter i 'd provisions perpetuate voting by mail provide federal control over redistricting and pave the way for dc statehood with legislation such as the john lewis voting rights act and the freedom to vote act lawmakers recently tried to restart those debates but when arizona senator kirsten cinema a centrist democrat announced that she would not support changes to senate voting rules the bills were once again dead in the water so during the press conference biden borrowed from donald trump warning about illegitimate elections if the results do not go his way speaking of voting rights legislation if this is not passed do you still believe the upcoming election will be fairly conducted and its results will be legitimate well it all depends on uh whether or not we are able to make the case to the american people that some of this is being set up to try to alter the outcome of the election now remember on the eve of biden 's inauguration president trump was removed from social media and overall polite society for making the same claim about the 2020 elections even cnn realized that biden 's claim was absurd but that was pretty much the only slap on the risk he received it is striking to hear an american president not name donald trump raise questions about the legitimate legitimacy and sanctity of our democracy i get the point he was trying to make strikingly the president said that the upcoming midterm elections might not be legitimate if the election reform bills before the senate are not passed but in perhaps the best example of disconnection from reality in the entire press conference biden said confidently that he do not over promise but probably outperformed expectations for his presidency did you over promise to the american public what you could achieve in your first year in office and how do you plan to course correct going forward why are you such an optimist look i do not over promise and but i have probably uh outperformed what anybody thought would happen well let that one speak for itself but how did the nation respond to biden 's first year presser for one pbs journalist yamiche alcindor lavished praise upon the event saying biden pushed back on critics called out lies took responsibility for mistakes he believes he made expressed surprise at gop talked foreign policy and do not lash out on reporters needless to say that 's the opposite of what happened on the other side of the aisle fox news host and former trump white house press secretary kelly mceninny shredded the press conference to pieces calling it delusional and remarking that she walked away genuinely scared for the future of our country what about the american public which is already disillusioned and clearly able to see right through biden 's propaganda time will soon tell but the white house is trying to be persuasive as best they know how enlisting a celebrity after the press conference the biden administration released a promotional video of actor tom hanks rattling off biden 's accomplishments america is the home of the brave it 's why we keep getting up no matter how many times we get knocked down social media users soon remembered a scene from the simpsons in which the government also used tom hanks to kick up their lagging credibility,0.6034,"so i mean that that 's the situation in in the gaza strip when it comes to the west bank judan and samaria giving again the question is giving money to whom the palestinian authority is going to pay $ 3 million in stipend to the in grants to the families of the hamas terrorists who committed these murders there 's still pay for inside the palestinian authority not not only that palestinian islamic jihad is the other governing party in the so - called west bank they just fired a rocket that killed a bunch of people at a hospital supposedly so why where where exactly is that money going again one of the biggest problems here and this is the problem that israel faces on on all fronts and this is why this is an existential crisis if israel does not take out hamas successfully that is going to embolden terror groups in jud and samaria the west bank to then commit acts of terror against jews throughout the state of israel israel is a tiny country people do people have never been there do not understand what we are talking about when you say things like this is an existential threat because they think well america 's giant and large i mean if there was something that happened in new jersey would that necessarily affect me in florida israel in certain places is 9 miles wide literally 9 miles wide tulkarm which is the site of an ongoing operation by israeli police to stop terrorist organization is located like eight and a half miles from the mediterranean ocean right now israel is facing an existential threat on its northern border as well from hezbollah which has 150,000 rockets minimum pointed at the north and center of israel these are highly sophisticated rockets these are not the dumb bombs that hamas has been sending into israel the early estimates are that if if hezbollah were to get in full scale it would not be 1500 jews it would be 20,000 jews de in like the first week of a conflict so the notion that israel that we should be number one signing checks to anybody who is in league with hamas or who 's giving money to kamas or who is sympathetic to hamas is totally insane and then the notion that israel should not be able to finish off kamas is going to be so damaging for israel because again the reason israel has been able to maintain its presence in the middle east is because there is only one coin of the realm in the middle east and that 's strength it 's the only coin of the realm there 's no such thing as moral swas there 's no such thing as mutual forgiveness and highness that is not a thing that happens the reason that israel exists there is because of the perception of israel 's military invulnerability israel does have an incredibly strong military but what happened on october 7th punctures the notion that israel is impregnable and that is something israel is going to have to reestablish in short order or it 's going to be tested again and again and again ben i am going to have my guys put the map up again because i am glad you mentioned the size because i know people are confused about the politics around this area uh but it 's also the tiny size as you are saying n9 miles wide if you do not include the west bank there as people can see where tel aviv is but the other point that i have been trying to make and i i have been literally making this point for years when and i am not the only one obviously when when these outbreaks happen with hamas can we go back to the map one more time if you look at the southern tip of gaza there there is a massive border with egypt that 's sinai next to it sinai is way bigger than all of israel put together uh it seems odd to me that nobody in the international community is calling on egypt to just open their borders stop those crazy genocidal jews from killing all the palestinians and let them move to sinai where basically nobody lives and by the way israel gave sinai back to egypt in the name of peace which they have bas you know had in essence for a couple decades now israel tried to give gaza back to egypt and egypt said",1.0187,but you are willing to disrespect the identity of all women because you are trying to support trans women it absolutely makes no sense and most of the women at the table except the smart one are either ignorant afraid of getting canceled or they are delusional one of the two because any rational person that took biology in college i mean particular biology in high school would know that there 's just two genders that 's it and that 's why you say trans woman because we know that it 's not a woman it 's a man transitioning to identify as a woman always a man you are always going to have the ball and chain man you are always going to have uh the prostate issue you do not have ovaries you can not have children you can not have menstrual cycles that you can not you know these things are invaluable as a society to understand what a woman and a man is and for all the people that are saying look i am not in the trans community how about you respect me and the funny thing is we have women 's recognition month there ai not no trans woman to have any historical relevance because back in the day people were not doing this a man could not just say he a woman back in the day the women 's suffrage the women who sacrificed a lot so women can have opportunities where women they would be spinning in their grave so so hard that they would catch on fire to think that a society like this where women have fought so hard to be relevant in society to have a voice in society just to have women say i do not know what a woman is because a man is confused about who he is i wish like i think the world is going crazy i am just i really need hope in realizing that hopefully this is not most women because the majority of 90 plus percent of these women on the panel were all lockstepping delusion only one woman out of eight of the nine of these women eight or nine of these women actually gave a legitimate biological scientific statement i do not understand why this is the argument back and forth it should be very clear biologically speaking this is a woman and in today 's world that we live in if i was explaining this to people in outer space that there 's men who are either sexually deviant mentally disabled or i do not know you say they were born that way regardless they are delusioned to the fact that they think they are actually women when they are men whatever however you get to that point it 's an it 's a delusion and then in their delusion delusional state they have to use chemical components in their body in order to make the physical body match what they want it to be in reality because you are in a man body why can not you just why can not you just accept that you are a woman in a man 's body why can not the people do that just just be like i am,0.3231,i mean that guy is not fully functional and now we are setting up actual senate rules to accommodate the fact that he wants to wear gym shorts even though i am not sure that he has ever worked out in his life by the look of him but does not matter when john fetterman is making fun of you and succeeding that 's not exactly a win for republicans hey meanwhile again there are tons of things for republicans to talk about in this election cycle ranging from joe biden 's incompetence to his corruption all that stuff is on the table to talk about so what are republicans talking about well whatever is the latest revelation in the donald trump cases of course and again that 's not up to trump now because he seated that ground when he took activities particularly with regard to classified documents that put him directly in the crosshairs if you are a person who has the biggest target in human history on your back which is probably the case with donald trump in terms of media hating you why would you put yourself squarely in the crowd why would you make that target gigantic we are now learning according to particular sources that one of donald trump 's aids a uh a woman named molly michael she apparently has told authorities that donald trump attempted to obstruct justice or subordinate perjury according to abc news sources said michael told federal investigators the last year she grew increasingly concerned without trump handled the recurring request from the national archives for the return of all government documents being kept in boxes in mar - a - lago she felt trump 's claims about it at the time would be easy to disprove according to the sources sources said that after trump heard the fbi wanted to interview michael last year he said quote you do not know anything about the boxes it 's unclear what exactly he meant by that but this is leading a lot of people to suggest that he knew that you know about the boxes and therefore the he was basically telling her to fib to the fbi again none of this stuff is particularly good for donald trump it just is not on the other hand it is amazing how the doj continues to show its corrupt hand so as many of you know there 's been a large controversy surrounding ray apps ray epps has been targeted by people including tucker carlson he was a participant in the january 6th riots there 's tape of him telling people to go into the capitol building there 's tape of him the night before telling people to head over and invade the capitol building and all the rest of this and then he was never charged because he was never charged the suspicion was i am a part of a lot of people on the right and he must have been some sort of government plan well now apparently the doj is charging him but they are charging him with one misdemeanor count of disorderly or disruptive conduct on restricted grounds now a lot of people on the record say why does he get charged with pretty much nothing when there are other people who did not all that much on january 6th like wander around the building and spent months or years in jail why why is that he 's going to claim law enforcement is going to claim it 's because he cooperated that when he saw his name on tv he called up law enforcement apparently he 's going to plead guilty to the charge but slap on the rischarges post facto do not look much like justice to the vast majority of people who watch this stuff play out meanwhile over in pennsylvania josh shapiro who 's the governor of pennsylvania is promoting pennsylvania 's brand new program for automatic voter voter registration it 's pretty much like california 's motor voter law there are apparently half a dozen states or a dozen states that already have this on the books that you are automatically registered to vote when you get a driver 's license here 's josh shapiro championing this in pennsylvania i am proud to announce that for the first time ever pennsylvania is an automatic voter registration state that 's right from now on when you get or renew your driver 's license or an id card at the dmv you will be registered to vote unless you choose not to i made a commitment when i was campaigning for this office that we would bring automatic voter registration in pennsylvania and break down the barriers for legal eligible voters this is a key step to make our elections more secure adding important levels of verification to the voter registration process and by expanding voter registration at our dmvs we will save taxpayers time and money reduce the number of costly paper registrations so i am wondering how it actually adds voter security to have people simultaneously register to vote automatically but okay let us assume that 's all the case this this makes pennsylvania the 24th state to actually roll out this sort of automatic voter registration process now i understand why there are a lot of people on the right are very exercised over this a lot of people think that you know this paves the way for for example ballot harvesting and they are not wrong and the fact is that according to realclearpenssylvania.com writing america 's ballot harvesting capitals in suburban philly he says prior to the pandemic pennsylvania had passed an election reform law enabling mail - in voting unlike in - person voting which requires no voter id pennsylvania 's mail - in ballot process requires the applicant to provide id either a driver 's license or social security number county board of elections are required to verify the information or a ballot can not be cast pennsylvania 's mail - in voting has more fail safes than traditional in - person voting for fraud to occur with mail - in balloting and a skill that can affect a statewide election it has to happen in two points harvesters illegally obtaining a list of driver 's licenses or social security numbers to complete applications and then cast ballots without voters knowledge or board of elections workers conspiring to invalidate applications so is there a lot of ballot harvesting,0.3181,and we all know it because we see it a small failure a small disappointment frustration or disenchantment engenders within us a small death a small descent into the underworld a small requirement for rebirth a large failure produces a proportionately large catastrophe and transformation when you are compelled to talk to someone because you face divorce or the failure of a treasured ambition or the illness or death of someone close you are walking yourself through the eternal narrative stability crisis death transformation rebirth that 's the story of our lives that 's the fall and the re - establishment of paradise the idea that the savior is the figure who dies and resurrects is a representation in dramatic or narrative form of the brute fact that psychological progress indeed learning itself requires continual death and rebirth of lesser and greater magnitude if you are engaged in the serious interpersonal conflict or argument or facing a true crisis in your life the new information confronting you can not be incorporated without the oh so painful demise of your previous conceptions and all of the resistance comprehension of that pain necessarily entails that 's part and parcel of the process so famously described as assimilation and accommodation by the great developmental psychologist john piaget we each confront the world with a set of pre - conceptual ization x ' whose function is simultaneously to delimit and render pragmatic are varied perceptions thoughts and actions in the absence of this a priori we simply can not function nonetheless it is still insufficient no one ever knows enough and what we each do not yet know will at some moment of crisis become a vital importance when something new and hydra like confronts us and shakes us to our core what is old anachronistic within must therefore immolate itself and die it is very rare indeed to learn something profound without suffering the terrible pain of - dreams and the soul shaking terror of uncertainty and doubt this means that none of us should identify in the most fundamental sense with what we currently know and presume means as well that we should all come to understand that so that we do not remain confused about who we are this means that it is never sufficient to be conservative or to identify with the past or to become ideologically or dogmatically committed or to remain stubbornly anachronistic and unchanged the environment transforms headlong around us and we all must run as fast as we can as ellis 's red queen well knew just to stay in the same place it is not sufficient either to abandon tradition and structure entirely in a headlong and irresponsible rush towards the anomalous and revolutionary structure is insufficient but it is still necessary and the ethical requirement for respecting and maintaining it is still of paramount importance as well similarly avoid falling prey to the temptation of identifying with the chaotic depressing anxiety ridden and nihilism inducing state of affairs engendered by the terrible confrontation with the genuinely unknown even when thrust into the underworld by the dread events of our life we must not characterize ourselves as permanent inhabitants of that dark and dread place lest we lose hope despair and seek revenge to progress psychologically you must let go sacrifice time and again in the face of success of obstacles you must abandon those things that and often those people who are impeding your progress despite the fact that you may have held them very close to your heart when you are wrong when you have missed the mark when you have sinned because that is the meaning of sin you must let the part of you that is wrong and aiming improperly die then you must allow the new spirit manifesting itself within to spring to life that new spirit that 's the terrible information contained in whatever error you committed in living conjunction with the now transformed structures you originally employed to frame the situation that new spirit it 's a manifestation as well and in other words of the potential within you that had not yet been called forth by the previous travails of your life christ is symbolically the way and the truth of life and no one comes to the father except through him embracing the process of voluntary death and rebirth that is identical with psychological development means determining to move forward and upward despite the horrors of life it means as well symbolically speaking rejuvenating the dead father or rescuing him from stagnation and deterioration in the eternal underworld forthright individual confrontation with the unknown renews the individual but also catalyzes cultural revitalization this is the essence of christian ritual and belief articulated as a psychological principle we must identify with that part of ourselves that is always stretching beyond what we currently know and has the faith to let go of old certainties so that new patterns of being can be brought into place it is through identification with the process symbolized by easter that we are each redeemed and our culture revivified and salvaged we are all the slaves of pharisees and lawyers of those who place dogma above spirit at the cost of spirit we are all subject to betrayal by ourselves and by all those who surround us we are all facing extinction in the most torturous of manners but there is a spirit within us with sufficient courage to confront the true horrors of existence forthrightly to allow the transformation even death that such confrontation catalyzes to occur and to leap forward renewed how is it that life might prevail in the face of death and hell with arms open embracing its fate we are all fallen creatures and we all know it we are all separated from what should be and thrown into the world of death and despair we are all brutally crucified on the cross that is the reality of life itself to rebel against that fate merely worsens it transforming what could be mere tragedy into something indistinguishable from hell to argue bitterly and despair around the deathbed of a loved one to take a single example is to turn all the pain of death and loss into something far worse to accept instead is that simultaneously to transcend it 's certainly courage and truth and perhaps even love and these three forces are something to behold are they more powerful than despair and the desire for vengeance that is the christian suggestion and the christian command to act out the proposition that courage and truth and love are more powerful than death and despair and to accept what transpires as a consequence that is easter and the death and resurrection of christ we forget or remain blind to such things at our great peril,0.2259,oh when you when you are when you accept christ in your heart you already have the spirit it does not say that anywhere in the bible but that has never happened to anybody anybody ever it do not ever happen to anybody why do not we pre stuff that never happened in the bible if f just was not important and why just why do they preach it in ignazio through the book of acts why why did jesus get baptized when jesus came to john the baptist john said look lord you you the man you need to be baptized in me jesus got baptized he said to fulfill all righteousness john the baptist baptized jesus christ if baptism do not matter then why would jesus christ that our lord and savior do not get baptized if it means nothing why did jesus baptized all of his apostles if it means nothing why did peter name baptize three four thousand people on the a pentecost look at your scripture why did peter and them tell people to be baptized repent be baptized do not tarry do not tarry do not wait go get baptized immediately washing away the sins washing away your sins and i am going to tell you how this on animal be done with this baptism is for the remission of sins it 's for the remission of sins there 's no other reason for you to be playing around in water unless your sins are being remitted it is your actions in your faith in your heart is what god does to change you but you got to be faith without works is dead faith without works is dead faith and mess it is a faith without works is dead you can believe all you want and whatever you decide to believe in if you have no efforts towards what you believe it is dead ladies and gentlemen you can believe in your mind that you want to be baptized for three months if you do not put action behind your faith it is dead you can believe you are going to be a millionaire until you are blue in the face if you do not go invest and you do not go work hard you are going to it 's not going to mean anything you are just wishing on a star you could say i believe in christ all you want you can say what you want to say but your actions shall proceed that which validates your feet the apostles jesus will say ye of little faith they talk a big game but they doubt it peter walked on water just like jesus did he start to doubt he start to sink the only reason peter was waving to walk on water is because his faith the only reason he started to sink because of his faith you can say i am a walking water you will not you do not take the first step out there you ai not going to anything to mean anything that 's why he said so i said faith without works is dead,0.4291,i would say mostly expeditiously right they are just doing so out of expedience they are doing so they think that bloomberg is more dangerous in a general election than sanders now let me just make my preference is clear here because i am up front about my biases i would significantly prefer to see michael bloomberg as the democratic nominee than bernie sanders why number one i do not think bloomberg this is strong least advertised nationally i think in bloomberg is a new york billionaire i think donald trump is a new york billionaire i think trump has a more visceral connection with people in the midwest than michael bloomberg does i think that donald trump speaks with a more populist two tone it than michael bloomberg i do not think that bloomberg is nearly as strong as some people in the republican party apparently fear he is that 's number one i am not sure that bloomberg is all that much stronger than bernie but let us even assume that bloomberg is a stronger candidate in a general election than bernie i said earlier in the program in a general election i would give 60/40 odds on president trump beating mike beating bernie sanders let us say that those odds are fifty five forty five for trump against michael bloomberg yeah that he has slightly better odds of beating sanders than he does of beating bloomberg i would still prefer bloomberg as the democratic nominee because the downside risk of a bloomberg presidency is not the same as the downside risk of bernie sanders presidency it is not in fact the downside risk of a bloomberg candidacy is not the same as the downside risk of a sanders candidacy it is not good for america when the democratic party is the party of jeremy corbyn as opposed to the party as opposed to the party of tony blair it is not good for america when the democratic party is the party of ilhan omar and rasheeda talib as opposed to the party of dianne feinstein and scoop jackson aye,0.5813,from the creation of the printing press to the telegraph to radio and television each new form of media revolutionized society but the development of the internet far surpassed all previous communication technologies especially since it 's now fully mobile and in our pocket wherever we go it 's changed almost everything from how we interact with our friends to how we get our news and entertainment and now most people gage which topics and events are most popular based solely on whether or not they are trending on social media futurist george gilder noted that quote computer networks give every hacker the creative potential of a factory tycoon of the industrial era and the communications power of a tv magnet of the broadcasting era that 's the capability of what 's been dubbed internet 2.0 or the two - way communication networks the internet now enables instead of just static websites comedian dane cook was one of the first comics to use social media to promote himself in the early 2000s through myspace and many of his early critics called him a better marketer than a comic because they do not see his humor as all that funny but could not deny his popularity which was largely because he was an early adopter of the newly emerging social media technology similarly tila tequila became the most popular person on myspace in 2006 from posting racy photos of herself taking advantage of the new medium and getting floods of friend requests from lonely losers online who hope to connect with her in some way her popularity on myspace opened the door for her dating show a shot at love with tila tequila on mtv in 2007 which began her 15 minutes of fame which thankfully ran out soon after in the early years of social media most people just saw the technology as something to use for fun and as a way to entertain themselves or reconnect with old friends but as time went on the true ability to influence large numbers of people through it became apparent amateur video caught hillary clinton collapsing at the 9 11 memorial after her campaign and the mainstream media kept dismissing growing concerns that there was something wrong with her health in the final stretch of the 2016 presidential election the video first went viral through social media before finally getting covered in the mainstream press because so many people were talking about it the washington post which had been calling questions about her health conspiracy theories then finally admitted that hillary clinton 's health just became a real issue in the presidential campaign a bartender working at a fundraiser held by mitt romney in 2012 captured the then presidential candidate on video talking about how 47 percent of the country would not vote for him because they will support obama no matter what since they want free handouts so he was not going to pay much attention to them liberals pretend to be outraged and accuse me of not caring about half the country particularly lower class income folks and the video proved to be quite damaging to his campaign bloggers were the ones who first debunked the fake documents cbs news anchor dan rather claimed with the service records of george w bush from his time in the national guard matt drudge 's drudge report website first broke the monica lewinsky scandal when other outlets like newsweek were sitting on the story and refused to cover it that 's how powerful the internet has become facebook and google now account for 25 of all advertising spending both online and off social media has swallowed up the news business and the power shift has been revolutionary despite the big tech companies being an integral part of most people 's lives unlike almost every other company that offers products or services to the public there are no customer service phone numbers at facebook twitter youtube or google you can not get anyone on the phone to talk with them about the problems you have experienced or the grievances you have with the companies despite names like mark zuckerberg and jack dorsey attached to them they remain faceless corporations you can not get in touch with there 's no local branch you can visit where you can ask to speak with a manager and instead users are relegated to sending tweets or submitting a help ticket from within the app 's dashboard and those attempts to get answers often only result in automated responses thanking you for contacting them and saying they will try to look into it the social media giants are strangely anti - social and over the last four years have been increasingly wielding their editorial powers to control which posts people see and how many people can see certain posts and since the 2016 election we have seen a record number of conservatives completely banned from platforms for having the wrong opinions or posting uncomfortable facts about certain segments of the population the tech giants are even censoring memes that they have deemed offensive and do not want people to see there are several classic books that highlight the dangers of censorship and depict tyrannical governments that use their endless power to snuff out any opposition in hopes of maintaining their control over society george orwell 's 1984 which was first published in 1949 and fahrenheit 451 published in 1953 are two of the most popular examples and were not just written for entertainment they were meant to serve as a warning of what giant bureaucracies could do if their growing power goes unchecked but today in america it 's not the government that 's censoring what newspapers print or what airs on the evening news it 's silicon valley titans it 's mark zuckerberg jack dorsey and susan wojcicki and the marketplace of ideas they are losing and so these industry leaders are silencing influential opponents who speak out against the left 's attempted cultural revolution they are also trying to create a chilling effect by scaring people into not speaking out about certain issues or think twice before sharing certain information on social media out of fear that we will be socially ostracized or even fired from our job so many people are self - censoring themselves in what 's been called the spiral of silence the fewer people who speak out about an issue due to the fear of repercussions causes others who feel that they should say something to be more apprehensive about doing so because nobody else seems to be doing it which in turn causes even more people to stay silent causing the false impression that nobody seems to be opposed to what 's happening thankfully in the united states at least today the first amendment is still intact but in places like canada germany england scotland and other supposedly free countries people are being arrested and charged with hate speech crimes for posting things on their social media accounts that are critical of the islamization of europe from the mass influx of muslim refugees and for voicing their opposition to the lgbt agenda and for other things you are not supposed to think but while americans are still technically free to say these things without getting arrested there are other serious consequences since we are living in an online world where most people rely on a handful of apps to communicate with others back in 1997 harvard law professor larry lessig wrote an article for wired magazine titled tyranny in the infrastructure warning that quote laws affect the pace of technological change but the structures of software can do even more to curtail freedom in the long run he said the shackles built by programmers could well constrain us even more in his book cyber ethics morality and law in cyberspace richard a spinello expanded on this concern saying quote this notion that private code can be a more potent constraining force than public law has significant implications the use of code as a surrogate for law may mean that certain public goods or moral values once protected by law will now be ignored or compromised by those who develop or utilize the code and that 's where we find ourselves today technically private companies can ban people from their platforms as long as it 's not because of their race sex sexual orientation age disability country of origin or other legally protected class but political affiliation is not a protected class and companies could legally ban all republicans or all trump supporters if they wanted to laws and regulations are always many years behind innovation and the framers of the legislation governing our communication infrastructure could have never imagined the emergence of social media let alone how instrumental of a role it would play in our lives the telecommunications act of 1996 was passed by congress and signed into law by president clinton in order to overhaul the rules and the regulations governing communication systems in response to the development of the internet within the act was a sub - section called the communications decency act and section 230 of the law granted immunity to internet service providers domain registrars and website hosting services so if customers use these services in ways that violate copyright laws or criminal statutes the companies themselves are not liable for the legal consequences because they are not deemed publishers but platforms and are not responsible for what their customers are posting in other words if somebody posts an episode of the big bang theory television show on the youtube channel youtube is not responsible for that person violating cbs 's copyright as long as youtube promptly removes the infringing video once notified by cbs if they are notified because youtube provides a service i.e the platform to the public they can not necessarily prevent people from using that service to pro to post copyrighted material so they are given safe harbor and are immune from any civil or criminal penalties when their users break the law section 230 of the cda also granted immunity to internet service providers and interactive websites if third - party users post defamatory information about someone or even if they sell fake merchandise on ebay meaning ebay is not responsible only the person posting the fake listing today many big tech companies are abusing their immunity that 's granted to them by section 230 of the communication decency act by censoring certain posts and deciding themselves what to delete from their platforms when that content is not violating any laws they are now acting as publishers not platforms because they are making editorial decisions about what will and will not be allowed if a person posts something that does not violate any laws then why should the social media companies have the right to take it down if they are in the business of offering a platform for supposedly anyone to use currently there 's a loophole in section 230 that allows for what it calls good samaritan blocking and screening of obscene lewd excessively violent or otherwise objectionable content so these big tech companies interpret objectionable content as being facts or opinions that hurt liberals feelings or undermine the liberal agenda further evidence that section 230 of the cda is outdated and unfair can be seen in the fact that a court ruled that president trump can not block people on twitter after several trolls who he had blocked found a law firm that sued the president on their behalf the court ruled that trump can not block people on social media because it deprives them of access to official presidential statements and his feeds are considered to be a public square this begs the question why is facebook twitter and youtube allowed to deprive citizens access to the same public square if the president of the united states can not deprive someone of access to his statements on social media why should the tech companies be allowed to do that to ordinary citizens facebook and twitter are basically the modern day equivalent of a telephone or a post office they have become an intimate and crucial part of billions of people 's lives it 's how friends and family communicate with each other and share photos and videos it 's how they send out party invitations and look up old friends or family members they have lost touch with it 's how they get their news and it 's how they see what the president is saying imagine the phone company canceling your service because they do not like what you and your friends talked about that 's essentially what facebook and other social media platforms are doing today when they suspend people delete their posts or ban them completely because of what they say when their statements are not crimes but just a controversial divisive or quote hateful point of view the power these megacorporations have over billions of people on the planet to communicate with each other is staggering and the fact that they are working in concert together to enforce their arbitrary terms of service to silence certain people and certain points of view is beyond horrifying for years i have been warning people about this,0.2879,it 's a sad day for the court and for the country 50 years ago roe v wade was decided and has been the law of the land since then this landmark case protected woman 's right to choose her right to make intensely personal decisions with her doctor free from the entertainment from the interference of politics it reaffirmed basic principles of equality that women have the power to control their own destiny and it reinforced a fundamental right of privacy the right of each of us to choose how to live our lives now with rogue on let us be very clear the health and life of women in this nation are now at risk as chairman and ranking member of the senate judiciary committee as vice president now as president united states i have studied this case carefully i have overseen more supreme court confirmations than anyone today where this case was always discussed i believe roe v wade was the correct decision as a matter of constitutional law and application of the fundamental right to privacy and liberty and matters of family and personal autonomy it was a decision on a complex matter that drew a careful balance between a woman 's right to choose earlier in her pregnancy and the state 's ability to regulate later in her pregnancy a decision with broad national consensus the most americans of faith and backgrounds found acceptable that have been the law of the land for most of the lifetime of americans today and it was a constitutional principle upheld by justices appointed by democrat and republican presidents alike roe v wade was a 7 - 2 decision written by a justice appointed by a republican president richard nixon in the five decades that followed roe v wade just as appointed by republican presidents from eisenhower nixon and reagan george w bush were among the justices who voted to uphold the principles set forth in roe v wade it was three justices named by one president donald trump were the core of today 's decision to upend the scales of justice and eliminate a fundamental right for women in this country make no mistake this decision is a culmination of a deliberate effort over decades to upset balance of our law it 's a realization of an extreme ideology and a tragic error by the supreme court in my view the court has done what it has never done before expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many americans that had already been recognized the court 's decision to do so will have real and immediate consequences state laws banning abortion are automatically taking effect today jeopardizing the health of millions of women some without exceptions so extreme that women could be punished for protecting their health so extreme the women and girls were forced to bear their rapist child with a child a consequence it just it just stuns me so extreme the doctors will be criminalized for fulfilling their duty to care imagine having a young woman having to carry a child of incest as a consequence of incest no option too often the case the poor women are going to be hit the hardest it 's cruel in fact the court laid out state laws criminalizing abortion that go back to the 1800s as a rationale the court literally taking america back 150 years this is a sad day for the country in my view but it does not mean the fight 's over let me be very clear and unambiguous the only way we can secure a woman 's right to choose the balance that existed is for congress to restore the protections of roe v wade as federal law no executive action from the president can do that and of congress as it appears lacks the vote to vote to do that now voters need to make their voices heard this fall we must elect more senators and representatives who will codify right to choose into federal law once again elect more state leaders to protect this right at the local level we need to restore the protections of roe as law of the land we need to elect officials who will do that this fall roe is on the ballot personal freedoms are on the ballot the right to privacy liberty equality they are all on the ballot until then i will do all of my power to protect a woman 's right in states where they will face the consequences of today 's decision while the court 's decision casts a dark shadow of a large swath of the land many states in this country still recognize the woman 's right to choose so if a woman lives in a state that restricts abortion the supreme court 's decision does not prevent her from traveling from her home state to the state that allows it it does not prevent a doctor in that state and that state from treating her as the attorney general has made clear women must remain free to travel safely to another state to seek care they need my administration will defend that bedrock right if any state or local official high or low tries to interfere with a woman 's exercise and her basic right to travel i will do everything in my power to fight that deeply un - american attack my administration will also protect the woman 's access to medications that are approved by the food and drug administration the fda like contraception which is essential for preventative health care myth of prestone which the fda approved 20 years ago to safely end early pregnancies and it 's commonly used to treat miscarriages some states are saying that they will try to ban or severely restrict access to these medications but extremist governors and state legislators are looking to block the mail or search the person 's medicine cabinet or control a woman 's actions by tracking data on her apps she uses are wrong and extreme and out of touch with the majority of americans the american medical association the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists wrote to me and vice president harris stressing that these laws are not based on are not based on evidence and asking us to act to protect access to care they say by limiting access to these medicines maternal mortality will climb in america that 's what they say today i am directing the department of health and human services to take steps to ensure these critical medications are available to the fullest extent possible and the politicians can not interfere in the decisions that should be made between a woman and her doctor and my administration remain vigilant as the implications of this decision play out,0.7645,banning ukrainian imprint that do not stop the rise of ukrainian nationalism and in the aftermath of world war i civil war broke out in ukraine with the calada the government proclaiming ukrainian autonomy in june of 1917 ukrainian people 's republic was established on november 20th 1917 but the communist party of ukraine quickly set up a rival fighting force with the bolsheviks seizing the offensive the treaty of breast lov was signed by the uppr and the central powers in february 1918 with germany and austria promising military support for the upr against the bolsheviks and indeed the german austr hungarian empire expelled the bolsheviks from ukraine a second treaty of breast lovk was then signed between the bolsheviks and the central powers ending hostilities on the eastern front and promising recognition of the upr that do not work after a series of coups and counter cs in ukraine the situation was finally ended by the bolshevik reinvasion of ukraine in 1919 the ukrainian government appealed to the polish government a former enemy but their combined forces were then defeated by the

the nazis and the soviets the partition of poland between the nazis and russians ended with parts of poland incorporated into ukraine ukrainians generally fought with the red army against the nazis after the invasion of the ussr by hitler in 1941 although there were a smaller number of independent nationalists who engaged in alliances with the nazis against the soviets and also engaged in massacres of poles as well in an attempt to pursue ethnic homogenity in the region after the war in 1954 the soviet union transferred control of crimea to ukraine as well in 1991 the ussr broke up and ukraine declared itself an independent country with the borders that we are all familiar with those borders of ukraine were essentially set until 2014 when russia annexed crimea and occupied the donbas region so as you can see the history of the region pretty complicated a lot of moving borders a lot of territorial claims but putin claims that because ukraine 's borders have moved over time because its territory and population was divided repeatedly because russia occupied some parts of ukraine for some sads of time this means ukra has never existed that it is in fact a figment of the imagination that it is indeed an integral part of russia but this is simplifying something that 's really complex as we have seen as matthew leno associate professor of history at the university of rochester says quote when putin says this is the heritage of these three slavic peoples in one sense he 's not wrong but there 's no continuous line to be traced from this loose river confederation of the kevan rus to the russian state and there 's also no continuous line to be traced from this loose confederation to the ukrainian state this tension has created just enough ambiguity allowing putin to propagandize ukraine 's backstory but here is something absolutely clear the ukrainians while recognizing their historic ties to russia do not as a whole want to be part of russia they wish to retain their independence from russia even before the russian invasion of ukraine 64 % of ukrainians considered themselves citizens of ukraine rather than citizens of the broader region in the aftermath of the war that number jumped to 85 % it is important to say by the way that this was not true in crimea even before the russian annexation of that region in 2014 crime widely preferred annexation to russia in le of maintaining status in ukraine the same is also true in many separatist areas of the donbas region in other words life and borders are complicated so is ukraine but the putin argument for the invasion of ke and the dissolution of ukraine as an independent entity are not only wrong historically they are highly likely to lead to continued bloodshed and warfare in the region,0.6255,and you know k harris understands only the words that she 's rehearsed to nothing more if that moderator had asked k harris how exactly transnational gangs bypass walls she probably would have had no idea what to say she just freeze and stare straight ahead for hours without her canned talking points the democrat 's presidential nominee is completely unable to articulate a single thought even one that 's supposedly based on her own personal experience that 's probably why the kamla harris campaign has just announced that that kamla is gna have tim walls sitting next to her during her first unscripted interview as the democrats presidential nominee that interview will take place on thursday with a friendly news outlet cnn and it will be taped so any especially embarrassing moments can be edited out of the final broadcast but apparently a taped interview with cnn is not easy enough for k harris so she needs to have tim walls by her side throughout the whole thing she needs to have a man there to hold her hand after well over a month of preparation she still can not do it alone neither can tim walls apparently according to political quote one of the issues that harris world is currently working to address is how to deployed running mate tim walls in the media the danger in sending him out to big do big solo interviews is that he might not have a full command of where harris is on every issue as someone pointed out to us last night harris talks about the opportunity economy but if w were asked to define it would he know how in other words neither kla harris nor tim walls can sit for an interview alone without any assistance k 's problem is that she can not articulate a coherent thought meanwhile tim walls has no idea what kla harris 's policies are which you can hardly blame him because like she does not know what her policies are so the solution they have landed on is to send them both out at once to a friendly media outlet that hopefully will not ask about the whole border wall flip - flop because if cnn does ask ask about that there 's also plenty of tapee of tim walls mocking the idea of a border wall also watch and i think seeing uh a plan that 's out there talking about it with folks knowing that he 's not going to do anything you know he talks about this wall i always say let me know how high it is if it 's 25 ft,0.4622,"whatsoever roger v decided to renounce his us citizenship 10 years ago and moved to the caribbean after he was released from prison serving 10 months in a federal penitentiary for the crime of selling fireworks on ebay without a license you can sell fireworks online in the early 2000s when ebay and the internet was really just getting started so you could sell fireworks you still can sell fireworks online you just need a license so he do not have the license and instead of just issuing him fine they arrested him and then instead of just get him probation put him in prison for 10 months probably because i think he was involved in running for city council and his local community of silicon valley and was ruffling some feathers up there so left a really bad taste in his mouth for the united states government so being a one of those hardcore principled libertarians he literally renounced his citizenship and then left but when people do that the government makes them pay what 's called an expatriation tax which is a very hefty tax on everything that they own all of their property their entire net worth everything but because he 's bitcoin jesus he had been buying bitcoin since day one many of them just for pennies but because bitcoin has been hitting astonishingly high values approaching $ 100,000 the government now claims that he owes them millions and i read through this 26 page indictment which claims that some of the bitcoins that he paid tax on were classified as part of his business not his personal assets and so those were taxed differently so that 's tax evasion because one of his old businesses memory dealers.com accepted payment in bitcoin so they had accumulated a sizable amount and it was not until 2014 that the irs officially issued notice of how the virtual currencies cryptocurrencies should be treated in terms of tax purposes they claimed that it was property and then on property when you sell it you have to pay a capital gains tax and so a lot of people have not been paying the capital gains taxes so they did the courtesy of sending out tens of thousands of letters to people who had accounts on coinbase and other exchanges who their forensic auditing realized were not paying the proper taxes and so they started sending them out letters saying hey here are the new rules make sure that you amend your tax returns and pay what you supposedly owe but right after roger 's book came out which does not just detail the history of bitcoin it goes deep into the forking of bitcoin into bitcoin cash and the big block versus the small block wars and all this kind of complicated technical stuff if you are a bitcoiner then you know i am not a bitcoiner",0.6667,as of the filming of this video the youtube channel associated with gavin mcginnis has been taken down for multiple third - party claims of copyright infringement and thus gavin mcinnes has now been wiped from the internet not too dissimilar to what we saw with alex jones though with gavin it was a slow process his twitter was banned his instagram was banned his facebook was banned we learned the other day that he is no longer affiliated with cr tv which has now merged with the blaze for reasons that are unclear they say they can not comment on it some people have expressed that they believe gavin mcinnes voluntarily stepped down while many others on the left say that he was actually forcefully removed we do not know for sure so today let us take a look at exactly why gavin mcinnes has been removed and what is currently going on but before we get started i want to give a quick shout out to my sponsor virtual shield virtual shield is a virtual private network service that means they help keep your data safe while you browse the web it is a simple layer

of copyright infringement regarding material the user posted i wonder who had filed multiple third - party claims because i can only assume it would be the blaze who else would have claimed to all of gavin 's content not entirely sure this is a cached version of gavin mcinnes his youtube channel we can see at two hundred twenty three thousand subscribers and we can see his banner image and many other videos associate with gavin however currently this is what it actually looks like now i looked at some of the videos posted to the cached version to see who may have laid claim in one of his videos it just says the account associate with this video has been terminated due to multiple third - party notifications a second video says the exact same thing however there are a few videos that say the video was taken down due to copyright claims by van 's incorporated so it may be that just today there was another copyright claim combined with older claims like this one from vance and that resulted in his channel finally being down many people are right now speculating that it was an activist campaign to get his last social channel removed and that may be the case but there has been a ton of controversy surrounding gavin mcginnis over the past several months just before we saw his youtube channel get taken down this story emerged just the other day proud boys founder gavin mcinnes out at blaze media blaze media no longer has a relationship with gavin mcginnis and per company policy can not comment on personnel matters the company tweeted nbc news says the ouster comes two weeks after mcguinness who also co - founded vice media disassociated himself from the proud boys a club of self - described western chauvinists who the southern poverty law center has described as racist and sexist extremists they say on sunday mcginnises show get off my lawn appeared to have been scrubbed from the company 's website the company 's co - president gaston mooney described mcguinness to cnn last week as a comedian and provocateur one of the many varied voices and viewpoints on blaze media platforms the news broke two days ago when we saw this tweet from blaze tv blaze media no longer has a relationship with gavin mcginnis as per company policy can not comment on personnel matters now a lot of people think this means that gavin was fired we do not know because they have not issued a comment some people have speculated that gavin after stepping down from the crowd voice is further trying to back away from his public persona in an effort to protect the proud boys who are facing incarceration he said as much in a video where he said he was stepping down from the proud boys though he technically said he was not stepping down because he was not the leader in the first place though he did found the group and doing so may actually help some of the other proud boys who are potentially going to be put in prison for violence that occurred in new york city but this is still just speculation i would actually say for the most part i would lean a little bit more towards gavin probably removed himself to protect the proud boys simply because he stated his intention to do so not to leave the blaze not to take down his youtube or anything like that his youtube was taken down for copyright infringement but he did express a desire to actually step back if it would help these guys who are facing prison time however again it 's still speculation and we have no idea glenn beck did an interview with gavin mcinnes not that long ago when he was banned from twitter and it seemed like they do not have a a negative relationship so i 'd be surprised if the blaze actually fired him,0.175,"yes the money disappearing for the next two months is a major problem the jobs disappearing is a forever problem if those businesses go under who exactly is going to hire the workers this is how you get to bernie sanders federal jobs guarantee and the government made this happen all by simply declaring that the economy will shut down now again you wanna say it 's temper you want to say you got a plan to fix this thing and show me how it 's temporary and the plan to fix this thing is actually going to be effectuated otherwise we seriously need to be considering what the measures we are taking here are the wall the wall street journal editorial board has a good piece on this today titled rethinking the coronavirus shutdown they say financial markets pause their slide on thursday but no one should think this rolling economic calamity is over if this government ordered shutdown continues for much more than another week or two the human cost of job losses and bankruptcies will exceed what most americans imagine this will not be popular in some quarters but federal and state officials need to start adjusting their antivirus strategy now to avoid an economic recession that will dwarf the harm from 2008 - 2009 the vast social distancing project of last 10 days or so has been necessary and has done much good warnings about large gatherings more than 10 people in limiting access to nursing homes will save lives the public has received a crucial education in hygiene and disease prevention even young people may get the message with any luck the behavior change will reduce coronavirus spreads that were not overwhelmed but the cost of the national shutdown are growing by the hour and we do not mean federal spending we mean a tsunami of economic destruction that will cause tens of millions to lose their jobs as commerce and production simply cease many large companies can withstand a few weeks without revenue but that is not true of millions of small and mid - sized firms even cash - rich businesses operate on thin margins and can bleed through reserves in a month 100 % true if you are a profitable business that means you had enough to pay your workers this month and then you have a little bit left over it does not mean you have a multiple of your entire company budget lying in a bank somewhere that 's not the way this works first the lay off employees and then have a necessity they will shut down another month like this week the layoffs will be measured in millions of people the deadweight loss in production will be found says the wall street journal and take years to rebuild in a normal recession the u.s . loses about 5 % of national output over the course of a year or two in this case we may lose that much or twice as much this month alone wall street economist ed hyman on thursday just at his estimate for the second quarter - an annual rate loss in gdp - 20 percent that is the entire economy of the united states losing one - fifth of its production if gdp consensus seems abstract consider the human cost think about the entrepreneur who has invested his life in the memphis ribs joint i mentioned this earlier only to see his customers vanish in a week or the retail channel 30 stores that employs hundreds but sees no sales and has to shut its doors or the recent gradual is 20 grand in student loan debt who finds herself laid off from her first job maybe she can live at home what if mom and dad do not have a job or alternatively what if she is 20 and her parents are 65 some of the media who do not understand american business say they are trying to manage two comparable shock you have the difference is that china 's communist country they do not care if a bunch of people are out of work or die if they cared about that there would be a communist country the politicians in washington says the journal are telling americans as they always do they are riding to the rescue by writing checks to individuals but there 's no amount of money that can make up for losses in the magnitude we are facing if this extends for several more weeks after the first trillion this month we are going to spend another trillion in april and another in june and you can see this in the bond yields who the hell is going to buy this stuff who the hell is going to buy any of this stuff by the way the market is off again today the market immediately upon opening dropped something like 500 points the market continues to to drop fairly dramatically and that is because nobody feels secure here nobody is going to buy up debt they feel is never going to be repaid by the time the treasury 's small business lending program runs through the bureaucratic hoops complete with ordering owners they can not lay off anyone as a price for getting the loan which of course is not going to be a thing millions of businesses will be bankrupt tens of millions will be jobless that 's of course true because you are not even allowed to lay anybody often in the nut in the knowledge that the next couple of years i want to be super rough so you are going to take that loan only not be able to pay anyone anyway and go bankrupt two months from now perhaps we will be lucky says the wall street journal the human and capitalist genius for innovation will produce a vaccine faster than expected or at least treatments that reduce covered 19 symptoms barring that our leaders in our society will very soon need to shift their virus fighting strategy to something sustainable dr . fowey has explained the severe lockdown policy has lasting 14 days in its initial term the national guidance would then be reconsidered depending on the spread of the disease that should be the moment to offer new guidance on what might be called phase 2 of the corona virus pandemic campaign and that will surely include strict measures to isolate and protect the most vulnerable are elderly those are the underlying medical problems this should not be a debate over how many lives to sacrifice against how many lost jobs we can tolerate substantial social distancing other measures will have to continue in some form for some time but no society can safeguard public health for long at the cost of the entire economy 's health even america 's resources to fight a viral plague are not limitless and they will become more limited by the day when no one has a job when no one is able to go out of the house meanwhile the white house is trying to float 50 and 25 year bonds to finance the stimulus packages who the hell is going to buy that like seriously why would you buy a 50 year bond because either you believe that the economy is going to rise in which case you would not buy a 50 year bond you buy stock or you believe the economy is going to decline in which case why in the living hell would you trust the american government to pay you back 50 years from now i can not trust the american government to pay me back five minutes from now forget 50 years from now the bond yields again are up bond yields move in inverse proportion to demand when demand for bond yield for bonds is down the yields go up the bond yields are up people do not want to buy bonds they do not trust the government right now now speaking of lack of trust in government you want to talk about dramatically undermining and continuing to undermine trust in government this story from the daily beast is devastating senator kelly loffler apparently dumped millions in stock after a coronavirus briefing she 's the second senator who got rid of her holdings right as the stock market went bad it turns out there for such senators who got rid of their stocks as the stock market went bad now some of these i want to be accurate in the reporting here our listing for example senator dianne feinstein among the senators who got rid of stock the pattern of her selling stock does not appear to be the same as some of the more egregious apparent abuses of the system feinstein serves as ranking member of the senate judiciary committee and her husband sold between 1.5 million and 6 million dollars in stock in california biotech company allergy and therapeutics between january 31st and february 18th according to the new york times feinstein apparently was not directly involved in the sale her assets are in a blind trust according to her spokesperson she has no involvement in her husband 's financial decisions reports identified three other senators james inhofe kelly lafleur of georgia and richard burr of north carolina as people who are selling vast amounts of stock feinstein 's does not appear to match the pattern simply because she do not actually make a lot of money on the on the stock sale as opposed to and the same thing is for vinho loffler and richard burr are a bit of a different story burr apparently was the chairman of the senate intelligence committee used more than 30 transactions to dump between 630,000 and 1.7 two million dollars on february 13th according to pro publica that reports that the transactions involves a significant percentage of the senators holdings and took place about a week before the impact of the virus outbreaks and stock prices plunging to the point where gains made during president trump 's term in office were largely erased a burst spokesperson said senator burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the us financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak as the situation continues to evolve daily he 's been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy on friday the senator tweeted an updated statement saying he relied only on public news reports to guide his decision on the sale he 's asking for a senate ethics committee review of his actions burr was an author of the pandemic and all - hazards preparedness act a law that helps determine the federal response to situations like coronavirus outbreak first office would not comment on what kind of information burr received about corn virus prior to his stock sales apparently burr made ominous comments comments about coronavirus behind closed doors at last month he senator february 27th meeting of business leaders in washington quote there 's one thing i can tell you about this",0.4946,and it 's not just with regard to the the basic notion that all sexual behavior is completely equivalent morally speaking which cuts against you know virtually all religious religious belief over the course of several millennia as well as natural law theory it is also about the basic idea that men can become women and women can become men betsy mccoy wrote about this for the new york post back in december she said militant transgender advocates are imposing their agenda with uncompromising zeal on school children which is fine with president biden his administration announced this month that by april it will enhance the legal entitlements of transgender public school students with new guarantees regarding access to bathrooms locker rooms and sports competitions these issues grab the headlines but they are less harmful to most students than the damage being done by the distortion of the school curriculum from the youngest age students are being brainwashed with gender ideology children as young as five are being encouraged to disregard their anatomy and choose their gender based on their feelings last week a california mother rage at the spreckels union school district board for allowing teachers to coach her 12 year old daughter on becoming a boy choosing a boy 's name and hiding the plan from the family a school a book school libraries offer for kids aged four to eight reads this is ruthie she is a transgender girl that means when she was born everyone thought she was a boy until she grew a little older old enough to tell everyone she 's actually a girl maine 's department of education reports that between 13 and 18 of public high school students say they are lesbian gay bisexual or unsure of their sexual identity which of course is not shocking considering that when you indoctrinate kids into sexual confusion and gender confusion they end up confused this is not a particularly shocking thing public schools should not be taking sides but maine and many other states they are on december 8th when the u.s supreme court heard oral arguments in a case involving maine 's public schools the state 's attorney christopher taub insisted they are religiously neutral that 's a laugh justice samuel elito was skeptical asking tab if he 'd say that schools that teach critical race theory tab duck the question ali should have asked about maine 's transgender curriculum it 's the left 's new religion there 's nothing neutral about it of course this is true the left strategy always is to grab a hold of the public school system and then indoctrinate kids into what they ought to believe about this stuff against their parents by the way in direct opposition to their parents and then to claim that their freedom of speech is somehow being silenced again your freedom of speech as a teacher is of very little consequence when it comes to the curricula that are mandated by school districts across the nation you do not have the ability to just go into the classroom as a teacher and then speak freely on any topic you choose that is not your job it is not first amendment rights like the breadth of first amendment rights is much narrower when it comes to what you are allowed to teach my kid in school and it should be because when a parent delegates the power to teach their kid they are not delegating the power for the teacher to completely override their value system and teach their kids a bunch of unscientifically based gender identity garbage but again the the the comeback from the left is basically just whining the basic idea is that we are supposed to just whine about this that if i am not allowed to come into a classroom and teach the small school children about my gay marriage this means that my rights have been violated no it means that parents get to decide what they want their kids to learn not you predominantly but here 's greg sergeant from the washington post and again he sort of gives away the game because it is not the belief system of these folks that parents ought to have any autonomy over what their kids learn when it comes to morality they believe that teachers who are best placed to do all this stuff have been trained by the geniuses at the department of education in left - wing sexual mores should be able to teach your kids whatever they please here 's greg sergeant today,0.5325,here 's the statement from chris murphy again there 's been no talk on the left none about why this is inappropriate why he should not be talking this way he tweeted quote he put out a statement said the paralysis you feel right now the impotent helplessness that washes over you as a news of another mass slaughter scrolls across the television screen is not real it 's a fiction created and methodically cultivated by the gun lobby decides to assure that no laws are passed to make america safer because those laws would cut into their profits again cut into the nra s profits the nra does not sell guns they do not sell guns how would that cut into the nr a-- 's profits if you ban you know people with misdemeanor violent crimes against family from from owning guns which we already have with that seriously interfere with the with the nra and anyway would not even seriously interfere with the profit margins of gun dealerships i think not he said my own is again chris murphy my heart sunk to the pit of my stomach once again when i heard of today in texas my heart dropped further when i thought about the growing mccobb club of families in las vegas in orlando in charleston a new town who after lived their own day of horror every time another mass shooting occurs now one of the things that i think is worthwhile noting here before we even go any further and talk about some of the myths that are being pervade by folks on the left with regard to this shooting i think it 's important to note that the left and right treat terror attacks and active violence in very very different fashion the left assumes that human beings are basically good human beings are basically good and therefore if you pass a law most people will obey that law and that if you do not pass the law basically human beings as restrained by the state are basically good that there will not be a bad guy who breaks the law and goes out and gets a gun and therefore because human beings are inherently good we do not need to worry about somebody breaking the law and the best thing to do would basically be for everyone to put down their arms on an international level this leads to the sort of pacifism that led to the anti - nuke movement the idea that if we unilaterally disarm we will create a world without nukes you saw some of this kind of pie in the sky stuff from president obama when he was senator obama the right thing something different people on the right tend to think in religious terms and natural law terms that human beings are capable of both great good and great evil and then a bad guy with the gun is separated from a good guy with the gun by the by the fact that there 's our the by the fact that one is good and one is bad they are not separated by the gun they are separated by the fact that one is good and one is bad and this is the problem is how do you group these people so if the left sees two guys with guns the left first instinct is to say the guns should be taken away from both of them the rights first instinct is to say well who are they where is the guy on the right a cop is the guy on the right good is the guy in the right a preacher is the guy on the right doctor is the guy on the left a vagrant with violent history like we have to separate by human being whether or not that person should have a particular capacity the right tends to look to the vagaries of human nature when they when they see sin and evil and the left tends to look to the implements of violence now i think there 's a halfway position that there are a lot of people who adopt they say okay human beings can be good human beings can be bad but there are some guns that are too dangerous for even a good human being to own i think most people agree with that with regards to for example fully automatic machine guns which have been banned in the united states at least new sales of those since the 1980s and there 's a lot of people who feel the same way about you know everyone owning it i think that 's reacting that 's reasonable and rational that 's where you can have reasonable rational discussion is which weapons are too dangerous that the risk outweighs the benefit right the risk outweighs the reward but that 's not the conversation left wants to have the left wants to have the conversation basically that all guns are bad because the same exact weapon that was used to gun down these people at the church was probably used by one of these civilians in order to fire at the bad guy running away from the scene,0.5622
you know i can send money on a weekend it costs you know it 's less for me to transfer money to uh family overseas like you know the utility is such that that i think eventually the technology will win out so the real question i think for the banks or the payment companies or anybody built on the legacy systems is do you get disrupted and go to zero over the next 20 years or do you embrace this stuff go through a really really difficult transition and upend your entire organization but survive to get to the other side because at this point i think it 's no longer an if this thing will happen question it 's really a when will this thing happen question um you know if you look at the data around the stuff for example you know uh especially when you look at the demographics i mean we talk about this as a massive massive demographic shift uh you know uh 25 of millennials own crypto if you look at the wealthiest millennials right 80 of millennial millionaires own crypto if you look at the preference for using these technologies um you know over a third of of people under 40 would rather uh have crypto than than stocks and and so you know the usage and acceptance of these systems is going through the roof when you look at the demographics you know especially when you look at young people and so it 's an inevitability in my opinion right as as the population grows up as the people who are in their 20s 30s and 40s you know go grow up over the next 20 years they are going to prefer these systems and so as a business i think the question you have to be asking is actually i think very similar to the question politicians have to be asking which is well if this is coming and it 's inevitable and everybody that wants this stuff is you know going from being 20 to being 40 and being you know going from being 40 to being 60 and they have all the money and they have all the power what do you do like which side of history do you want to be on uh and i think the answer is very clear,0.1073,she 's so far ahead of the santis that there is no reason to make herself vulnerable to that abc news then duly called off the republican primary debate they announced that there would be no debate at all they said our intent was to host a debate coming out of the iowa caucuses but we always knew that ' be contingent on the candidates and the outcome of the race while while our robust election coverage will continue abc news and wmtv will not be moving forward with thursday 's republican presidential primary debate in new hampshire now again do i think that new hampshire is quite as close to that poll as making out i do not i think that donald trump does in fact have the upper hand in new hampshire even should nikki haley pull out some sort of upset win in new hampshire they would then head down to south carolina where donald trump does have a fairly substantial lead in that particular race remember that new hampshire was a place where chris christie was pulling in the double digits until he dropped out presumably a lot of that support is going to flow over to nikki haley but let us be real about this all eyes are already turning to the general election and because all eyes are turning to the general election that means we have to look at the strategy that democrats are using to defeat donald trump well to understand that strategy you really have to speculate on whether this is all as admiral abar might say a trap whether in fact democrat 's plan was to basically get republicans to nominate donald trump so that they could run against him of course they tried this trap in 2015 2016 hillary clinton suggested that donald trump w run she wanted donald trump to be the republican nominee and then of course she lost to him are democrats repeating history andy mccarthy at national review suggests that that 's the case because he says that basically by promoting all of these legal cases against donald trump this year that opened up the primary in favor of donald trump they reversed all of the momentum in the race in favor of donald trump because the republicans reacted to the unjust persecution of trump by supporting him in the race and then the entire next year is going to be all about his legal cases and in fact there 's some data to support this if you look at the republican presidential primary polling what you see is that right after the 2022 elections donald trump and ronda sanis were running basically neck and neck and then they continued to run neck and neck through january through february and then something happened in march what happened in march the announcement of prosecutions against donald trump once that happened the polls opened up wide the damn burst and republicans moved behind donald trump because they perceived that donald trump was being unduly persecuted and donald trump 's line which was effectively that they are coming after me because they will also come after you was an effective line that 's particularly effective when the democratic party is making clear that the center of all of its policies lies equity equity equity and when many americans hear equity what they mean is the preferred democratic voting constituencies are going to get special benefits and everybody else is going to get jacked so when donald trump says they are coming after me because they are also coming after you that does have some credibility to it that said the next year obviously is going to be a very stacked year for donald trump in terms of the various calendars we will get some more on this in just one second first as you have already seen 2024 is going to be a wild ride you already seeing the impacts of inflation at the gas pump the grocery store the dollar is losing its buying power faster than wages can increase so let me ask you a question how are you protecting your savings consider diversifying with gold from birch gold group for decades gold has been the choice of investors and central banks to hedge against inflation i have invested in precious metals before i have diversified it 's a smart thing to do because again diversification good strategy against the terrible possibility of future events birch gold can help you create a well - thought out and balanced investment strategy that will help you convert an existing ira or 401 k into an ira in gold without paying a penny out of pocket this month only when you open that gold ira with birch gold you will get a free signed copy of my book the authoritarian moment but you need to text ben to 98 9898 to qualify birch gold has been the exclusive gold company of the daily wire for the past 7 years i buy my gold from them and you can too text ben to 9898 98 protect your savings claim your eligibility for a free signed copy of the authoritarian moment so here is where we stand in terms of the calendar the judicial calendar so on january 8th arguments in washington federal appeals court over trump 's claim to absolute immunity happened that 's already happened on january 10th the trump organization civil fraud charges closing arguments were made today there was a second trial that began in new york in which egene carroll a woman who alleged that donald trump raped her in a department store in new york city again allegations that i think are really dicey on their face,0.3599,so what can you can you walk through your your conclusions in that book like what what did you see as the causes you talked a little bit about the proclivity of one administration to forgive the sins of the previous you talked about the free past that was given to people who were involved in the 2008 financial scandal are there other what would you say are there other threats to the integrity of the law that you see as particularly germaine in the us at the moment i mean i think i think that book grew out of a concern that has intensified in the last decade that the west in general is now a society that has a larger breach than ever before between elites on the one hand and the vast majority of people on the other you referenced earlier for example the fact that many of the views that are now considered taboo or many of the beliefs that are considered unworthy of being aired are happened to be beliefs that majorities of people uh subscribe to and those prohibitions are being imposed by class that is so wildly at odds with the vast majority of people over whom they are essentially ruling which is a very destabilizing uh framework for a society to have if you look for example a polling data about crime and you listen to black or latino elites on television or people with newspaper columns you would think that the vast majority of non - white people want the police defunded want the police deconstructed hate the police do not want the police in their neighborhoods of course if you look at polling data you find the exact opposite is true black people latinos people any of any race who live in poor communities either want the same amount of police or more police in their neighborhood there 's this constant breach obviously with gender ideology there 's that breach with a lot of culture war issues with the question of endless warfare with the question of gigantic corporations between the views of the elite class and the views of the vast majority people over whom they are ruling and historically if you are to if you were to look at how that breach has been addressed there 's essentially two ways you can you can go about trying to to resolve that namely you know i think the election of donald trump the election of jer bolsonaro in brazil brexit the rides of a lot of these kind of populist parties are very much about the fact that huge numbers of people feel i think justifiably and validly that elite ideology does not care about them at all is willing to squeeze se every opportunity out of their life in order to benefit a small minority of people and when you have this kind of mass populist anger traditionally the elites can try and appease it by kind of throwing some more crumbs to people just to keep them just satiated enough that they are not going to go out into the street and cause political turmoil and protest and the like or the society can say you know what let them riot we will just militarize to the teeth we will give ourselves every kind of power and every kind of authoritarian uh weapon that we need so that even if they want to riot they will be crushed immediately i think the west is choosing that latter path of no longer trying to appease people no longer trying to give them enough to keep them at a decent uh quality of life or the perception that the system is essentially fair and instead is param militarizing is becoming more authoritarianism i think that 's what a lot of the trends in the west are about and that book was really a way of saying that even the law the kind of lynch pin of what is supposed to ultimately guarantee that even though we were supposed to have material differences the founders were capitalists they expected and anticipated that there would be differences in material wealth that the law would ultimately be the guarantor of the fairness of that inequality that people would accept its validity or its legitimacy because we were all operating by the same set of rules and increasingly the law has become something that 's the exact opposite just yet another weapon for elites to use against uh people who are powerless to keep them in line to keep them kind of uh neutered and toothless and that 's really the this the the the ethos out of which that book grew and the fact that elites have given themselves a kind of broadscale immunity that our prisons and our courtrooms or criminal courtrooms are not for wealthy people are not for powerful people with some exceptions but are overwhelmingly for poor people even ones who are addicted drugs committing nonviolent crimes that was the critique of of that book so let us segue from that into your 2014 book that 's no place to hide edward snowden the nsa and the us surveillance state and so well that obviously developed some of the themes that you were just discussing which is the proclivity of the elite and i have some questions about who you think the elite are exactly because that 's an interesting issue um tell me what you discovered and what you were attempting to accomplish with no place to hide that basically told the story of the work i did with edward snowden he had contacted me anonymously at the end of 2012 saying he had access to a huge trove of top secret documents that demonstrated that the us government its allies were engaged in a kind of ubiquitous surveillance that would shock people even such as myself who had been writing about that and had long suspected that was the case uh the kind of final straw for him was when he heard james clapper president obama 's senior national security official who was the director of national intelligence testified before the senate in early 2013 he was asked by senator ron widen of oregon does the nsa collect dossier on millions and millions of americans and james clapper lied and said no sir it does not not wittingly and snowden had in his hands the evidence because he had worked for for and then the nsa is a contractor the evidence proving that what clapper denied the nsa was doing was in fact exactly what the nsa was doing in fact to an extent that nobody would have suspected the motto of the nsa was collect it all they really wanted to and were well on their way to converting the internet into a tool of ubiquitous surveillance that everything done on the internet set on the internet by ordinary people american citizens suspected of no wrongdoing these were suspicionless this was suspicionless surveillance uh was being collected and stored with the potential when they wanted to analyze and utilize this information incredibly comprehensive pictures of our lives based on who we were speaking to what we were reading um the content of our communication and so i went to hong kong met was snowden along with the filmmaker war pess who filmed it that became the film that became the film that won the oscar in 2015 for best documentary citizen 4 very kind of high drama,0.1676,the current administration 's new year 's tax goals are to spend and turn a blind

officers was finally released the body camera uh the body camera footage is a couple different uh places where the footage is coming from in the body camera is harder to interpret we see tyree nichols fighting with the cops after having been apparently pulled over for reckless driving but the footage is sort of glittery uh blurry and jittery and difficult to discern the story is really told by footage from security cameras mounted to street lamps and there we can see the cops take turns beating and kicking nickels while he 's restrained the five of them together should have been able to figure out a way to subdue one man without pummeling him to death but these officers decided to use much more force than what the situation would seem to require in fact if you saw the video with the from the the street lamp security uh cameras without any other contacts you would not think that it was an arrest at all but rather like gang warfare look like street violence not officers of the law executing an arrest and the end result is that tyree nichols died in the hospital a few days after the beating now there 's still much we do not know about this incident and even though the video is quite brutal it 's still always worth keeping in mind that everyone is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law i would not be surprised if more details emerge in the coming weeks and months that will that while probably not exculpatory for the officers it 's very hard to imagine what kind of context could possibly let them off the hook here it might at least help to explain what exactly was going on did one or some of these cops have some sort of personal grudge against nichols is there a history here that we have not been told about which might explain why the beating looks so personal i have no idea hopefully we will find out more as time goes on what i do know though is that this event whatever precipitated it whatever explains it certainly had absolutely nothing to do with racism because this was a black man beaten by black cops who work for a department run by a black woman in a majority black city governed by a majority black city council there are no white faces anywhere near this incident which means that no honest and intelligent person could try to pin this one on whiteness or white supremacy but unfortunately for all of us honest and intelligent is a bar too high for many people especially those in the media to meet and so leftist activists and media propagandists immediately went to work trying to explain how the actions of five black men under the leadership of a black woman somehow represent an act of anti - black racism van jones over on cnn got the race baiting kicked off on friday night with an op - ed titled quote the police who killed tyree nichols were black but they might still have been driven by racism jones goes on to explain one of the sad facts about anti - black racism is that black people ourselves are not immune to its pernicious effects society 's message that black people are inferior unworthy and dangerous is pervasive over many decades numerous experiments have shown that these ideas can infiltrate black minds as well as white self - hatred is a real thing at the end of the day it is the race of the victim who is brutalized not the race of the violent cop that is most relevant in determining whether racial bias is a factor in police violence whether racial bias is a factor in police violence it 's hard to imagine five cops of any color beating a white person to death under similar circumstances and it 's almost impossible to imagine five black cops giving a white arrestee the kind of beatdown that nichols allegedly received there you have it white people are to blame even for things that white people do not do van jones bases all of this on uh on his own essentially his own lack of imagination because he says that uh that it 's hard to imagine a white person treated this way by cops hard to imagine and it might indeed be hard for him to imagine because he works for a media organization that simply ignores every occasion where a white person is killed by police it 's not that jones can not imagine a white person falling victim police brutality it 's that he chooses not to acknowledge such cases cases when they happen he chooses not to remember for example the worst police shooting ever caught on film the one where daniel shaver an unarmed white man is executed in the middle of a hotel hallway while on his knees begging for his life shaver skin color makes a story inconvenient and so it 's simply ignored like so many other stories just like it jones got to this narrative early and uh many soon followed though over the past few days twitter has been full of tweets like this one from anti - racism educator quote unquote tim wise who says anyone who says the killing of tyree nichols can not be about racism because the cops were also black really does not understand how white supremacy or anti - blackness work and then congressman maxwell alejandro frost says does not matter what color those police officers are the murder of tyree nichols is anti - black and the result of a system built on white supremacy political commentator monday or jones tweeted if you think the memphis police officers had to be white in order to exhibit anti - blackness you need to take that ap african - american studies course ron desantis just banned it is of course more accurate to say that if you think violence committed by five black men is somehow there is the fault of anti - black racism then you have probably taken way too many african - american studies courses in fact that kind of insane paranoid thinking exactly is exactly why those sorts of courses should not exist in public school in the first place and you could find this kind of messaging of course elsewhere on social media like on tick tock where this white woman explains why every white person is directly guilty of carrying out this beating you may think you have a good alibi maybe because you were in bed asleep in your home 500 miles away while it was happening but that does not mean you are not culpable she explains i got a message today for some white people if we have white people listening paying attention i would not mind if you would do this with me we rub our chests we find our heartbeat and we say we did this white supremacy did this i am talking about tyree nichols police do not do this the memphis police department do not do this white supremacy did this,0.5545,but it 's not really just the result of the poll the topline result of the poll that a problem for joe biden it is all the cross tabs the cross tabs are a disaster for joe biden cross tabs are the demographic breakdowns by group for the candidates so under this rubric the new york times sienna pole rubric by race donald trump in this poll wins hispanics outright 46 - 40 let us just be clear about this donald trump the guy who once tweeted out that he loves mexicans because tacos is beating joe biden 46 to 40 in this ball the guy who the entire media suggested would never be president because he said that mexican rapers were cross that guy is winning hispanics 46 - 40 which again demonstrates hispanic not a great catchall category not a great catchall term it actually encompasses a wide variety of people from a wide variety of backgrounds and countries he is winning them outright 46 to 40 but that 's not the only shocking cross tab in this poll among black voters joe biden is winning just 66 % versus 23 % for donald trump 66 % is the number to note there 23 % is it if any republican wins 23 % of the black vote in a presidential race that republican will be president of the united states but 66 % for joe biden is a full - scale disaster area you win two - thirds of the black vote and you are a democrat you are toast in a presidential race now again these cross tabs you have to take them with a certain grain of salt they have huge margins of error up to 10 points margins of error for some of these cross tabs because again when you a poll the accuracy of the poll depends on the number of people that you pll the larger generally the poll sample size the more accurate the poll when you are looking at a poll like this one where you might have 90 people who are hispanic responding there 's a lot of margin for error however if this poll is even remotely close joe biden is basically toast at this point donald trump is winning white voters outright 53 to 40 in terms of age demographic this is kind of a shocking one joe biden is winning people 65 and over which is kind of surprising because very often the older votes tend to skew republican but in this particular poll and in this election cycle voters aged 30 to 64 broadly favor donald trump over joe biden in this election particularly people aged 45 to 64 in other words the people who are just above the millennials the sort of gen x people those people are voting 54 to 36 for donald trump according to this poll women are split evenly between biden and trump there 's not one piece of data for joe biden in this poll and the most important thing about this poll is that what it does not show is that joe biden is wildly unpopular among democrats for example he shows there 's it shows there 's a lack of enthusiasm for joe biden among democratic base voters they are not quite as enthused to vote as republican base voters would be the real problem for joe biden is not with his base this is what i have been saying the real problem for joe biden is not with the kamas nik in deerborn michigan the real problem for joe biden is not with radical blm types inside the democratic party the problem for joe biden is that he governed as a radical bernie sanders type he got into office and he decided he was going to govern far to the left instead of entering with the coalition that brought him and then dancing with them he decided to jettison the entire center of the political spectrum and donald trump is gradually taking over the center of the political spectrum as we discussed last week on the show you can not name a position in modern american politics where joe biden now occupies the center and donald trump occupies the periphery it 's virtually always the other way around including mainstream democrat issues like abortion it is joe biden who is saying things like abortion up until birth and it is donald trump who 's not saying we ban abortion all the way from inception and conception he says we should ban abortion federally maybe at 16 weeks which is a pretty broad consensus position in the american populace joe biden has abandoned the moderates joe biden has lost the moderates how do you win those people back seriously how do you do it,0.6001,tommy john.com for the best underwear on planet earth tommy john.com ben remember october 7th was launched specifically with the green light of iran in order to scuttle the burgeoning israeli saudi peace deal that is what was was happening israel and saudi arabia were establishing a regional alliance in terms of defense to deter iran and its proxies in the region and that alliance deao included egypt it included jordan it also included a bunch of the saudi sponsored states like uae and bahrain a variety of these states had basically formed up an alliance and it was just really a matter of toppling that last domino in saudi arabia for the alliance to go full scale and if donald trump had been elected there is no doubt in my mind and by the way in the mind of the israelis or the saudis that that deal would have gotten done even with joe biden 's president though it appeared as though that deal was very close on the horizon not because joe biden is great at this but because he sucks at this and because joe biden had been so conciliatory toward the iranians the saudis had basically gone to the israelis and said listen we need to make a deal with you now because we do not trust the americans we do not trust that joe biden is going to come to our defense if in fact iran attacks us so let us form up a regional alliance against iran and that was really really close to happening in fact benjamin netanyahu the prime minister of israel had spoken openly about it at the united nations iran saw that iran activated hamas to go into israel and kill 1200 people and take 250 hostages back to the gaza strip in the hopes that this would start a conflagration that would burn down the possibility of sunni israeli deal well it appears that the status quo anti is now being reinforced why because israel has actually preserved its own ability to deter and militarily destroy its enemies the whole reason for a saudi peace deal with the israelis is not because israel and saudi arabia see eye to eye on matters of religion obviously they do not the reason for that is because saudi looks at israel and they say israel is capable of deterring iran israel is capable of destroying its enemies on the battlefront israel is a an extraordinarily powerful and innovative military machine and we want to be allied with that and so what hamas did by striking at israel was to dent that perception in the saudis israel has reinforced the perception the prior perception in the aftermath by its successful military action in the gaza strip which is why they are now going to go in and finish off rafa in the south of the gaza strip and the last two weeks have shown that israel not only is capable with its allies of repelling a mass iranian attack but also that israel can strike pretty much where it wants to in iran and so iran had better not escalate because it will be worse for iran than it will be for israel and saudi of course wants to sign on to that that is the m in other words what israel just did in iran is actually de - escalatory if israel wanted to escalate with iran certainly they could have they could have done that mass attack on their nuclear facilities for example or they could have tried to kill members of the regime in ton because they can hit anywhere in iran apparently they do not do that which is why it 's so amazing to watch as the media continue to know nothing about the middle east and yet report on it as though they do so for example nbc news reporter matt bradley suggest that israel 's strike against iran may have been destabilizing it 's the opposite if israel had not actually retaliated against a mass missile and drone attack against its own territory that would have been radically destabilizing because then iran would have sensed weakness and would have gone forward with for example activating kah in israel 's north but here are your typical journalistic idiots completely missing the point this could be a deeply deeply destabilizing move by the israelis and again not just for the iranians but for the entire region and it could even draw in the united states the united states has said that they are committed to defending israel 's security,1.0049,but it turns out that biology has some things to say about differences between the sexes and those do not always cut in favor of feminist notions about the differences between the sexes so there 's a study that the daily mail reports on today say women are more attracted to men who are sexist because they think they are more willing to protect them provide for them and commit to a relationship scientists say so poor poor feminists men who think that they were going to think that they were going to get some because they were because they were wearing the i am a feminist t - shirt it turns out that you are less that you are less prone to to be the the obvious victors in natural selection than the guy who just says men are men women are women and men 's job is to defend women you know why women kind of like that because women think that men 's job is to defend women even women who believe that men 's job is not to defend women believe that men 's job is to defend women all the same feminists in the meets you movement who think the men are predators then yell at men who do not do enough to protect women not men who are rapists men who do not protect women enough why because they understand there 's a social obligation that is real a moral obligation for men to defend women in a stronger way than men defend men men do not defend men as strongly as men defend women just a reality and women like that oops,0.3169,so last night there were a couple of local elections now as you know there 's a national show we do not tend to put too much stock in local elections or focus too much on local elections but in the lead up to 2020 everybody is looking for early indicators for how things are going to split and it 's funny when we talk about presidential elections we tend to talk in national terms obviously we tend to say that president trump is going to win x percent of the popular vote or kamala harris if she were the nominee would win an x percent of the popular vote the reality is that this election is going to come down to about three states it 's going to come down to wisconsin pennsylvania michigan that 's pretty much it the assumption is the president trump is going to walk away with ohio that assumption seems to hold pretty true florida is more competitive if he loses florida the election is over so assuming that trump wins florida and that he wins ohio then he still has to win two out of the three michigan pennsylvania or wisconsin in order for him to retain the presidency and the kind of conventional wisdom had been that trump was going to continue to be competitive in michigan and that in pennsylvania he was still somewhat competitive but that in wisconsin he was starting to fall off and the evidence for this is that the 2018 elections move wisconsin into more blue territory well last night there was a special election in wisconsin for the wisconsin supreme court now the wisconsin supreme court is not an overtly partisan seat it 's not like somebody runs as a republican or a democrat for the actual wisconsin supreme court but those candidates are backed by conservative groups or liberal groups and last night the conservative won in wisconsin ensuring that wisconsin supreme court would remain majority conservative for the foreseeable future because now instead of things being four to three on that supreme court and and ready to shift in a moment 's notice in 2020 now conservatives have a 5 - 2 majority on the wisconsin supreme court and not only that turnout was high and what the election showed is that well there were certain districts where trump has fallen off a little bit particularly in suburbia in rural areas he continues to dominate according to according to madison.com they report that the conservative is winning by a very small margin it may go to an automatic recount but the wisconsin supreme court race the liberals needed to win to have a shot at taking majority control of the court next year i appeared headed for a recount with the conservative candidate declaring victory while holding a narrow lead following tuesday 's election the conservative candidate is up over five thousand votes a conservative win would increase their majority to 5 - 2 and ensure their control over the court which they have held since 2008 for years to come it would be a particularly stinging defeat for liberals who were confident and riding a wave of wins in 2018 including picking up a supreme court seat and ousting republican governor scott walker conservative bryan hagedorn who was walker 's chief legal counsel for five years led liberal backs at lisa newbauer by 59 hundred votes out of 1.2 million cast based on the unofficial results that difference of about 0.49 percentage points is close enough for neubauer to request a recount but she would actually have to pay for it,0.3115,you know derrida went and foucault as well went a step farther and this is one of the incredibly crooked elements of their thinking i think another sleight of hand which was well category systems exclude political systems exclude economic systems exclude any hierarchy of value excludes obviously because if there was a hierarchy of value some things are more valuable than others and the less valuable things are excluded because otherwise it would not be a hierarchy of value but the the next claim they essentially make is that the reason that those hierarchies of value are constructed is not to produce whatever it is that 's of value but to exclude and to maintain the structure of power that 's intrinsic to the hierarchy of value and that 's a that 's an unbelievably crooked claim because there are multiple reasons why a hierarchy value might be put into place their hierarchies of beauty and there 's hierarchies of competence hierarchies of intelligence and and attractiveness and and athletic ability and musical talent there 's multiple hierarchies and in order for those things to exist at a high order in order for us to to to do laud what would you say musical genius we have to excuse all the people we have to exclude all the people who can only squawk their clarinet from the hierarchy because otherwise you do not have any music and there 's no up and there 's no direction and so to claim that the purpose of the hierarchy is to exclude is unbelievably crooked and it 's a central claim for both for both foucault and and derrida it 's one of those slights of hands that people do not quite notice but that have absolutely catastrophic effects now for foucault and derrida they you could here 's how you could imagine their world essentially you know for the for the philosopher hobbes life was nasty brutish and short and people were at each other 's throats in the state of nature right but hobbes really thought about that as a has the chaos of individuals and he believed that a central authority had to exert force in order to organize that intrinsic chaos so that some degree of peace could reign it 's kind of the opposite of jean - jacques rousseau 's theory which was that human beings were intrinsically good and and the state the the government was intrinsically bad and that all of what made people evil derived from the state i would say if you put hobbes and rousseau together you actually get the truth even though they do seem to be coming at it from opposite perspectives because people are actually good and evil and social structures are also good and evil and you know it 's paradoxical and we do not like paradoxical categories but that 's still how it is what what foucault and derrida and the post modernists did was that they kind of added a collective element to that so they are hobbesian world is not a world of individuals struggling against one another in the initial state of warlike nature it 's it 's groups of individuals bound by whatever their identity happens to be struggling against each each other for power because in the postmodern neo - marxist universe there 's nothing but power and there 's a variety of reasons for that partly it 's because the post modernists do not admit that there are any standards outside of arbitrary opinion essentially they do not really believe in the real world which is why they can generate critiques of science for example which is increasingly characterized as nothing but part of the eurocentric patriarchy 's what would you call desire to impose their power structure on the rest of the world despite the fact that it also makes planes fly and computers operate and well you know,0.2155,"halfway around the world in israel or which one occupies any of the disputed territories and to understand why jews do not celebrate easter or christmas and why many of them like the ones at the adl actively oppose it being a part of american culture one has to understand the history of christianity and how jews rejecting jesus as the son of god and the messiah has caused an ongoing division between jews and gentiles non - jews for over 2,000 years muslims actually believe jesus was a prophet they just do not believe that he was god in the flesh or that his death atoned for mankind 's sins muslims believe jesus was born of a virgin though which jews do not and that he performed miracles including restoring a blind man 's vision healing a leper and raising the dead all of this is written in the quran which contains some of the same stories as the christian bible in judaism on the other hand and among ginos jews and name only who no longer follow the jewish religion or even believe in god but still identify as jews culturally jesus is viewed as a fraud and a false prophet and because of the events that led to his crucifixion and being rejected by the ancient israelites as the messiah many jews and christians have had an of intense opposition between each other ever since very few christians today have an understanding of the tens and ongoing opposition many jews have towards christians which can clearly be seen when you realize that the adl is upset that public schools often have students draw pictures of santa claus during arts and crafts time in december mainstream news outlets like nbc news even published articles claiming that christmas music is oppressive to jews after mel gibson 's blockbuster film the passion of the christ was released in 2004 it was widely denounced as anti - semitic by the adl and jewish film critics because it was the most popular film about jesus in generations it 's rare for biblical dramas to become so popular in the mainstream but almost 10 years later after the passion of the christ came out the history channels miniseries the bible was a big hit in 2013 and like clock work the same cries of anti - semitism rang out about that as well and while in the the distant past christians do not view jews too favorably to say the least the diametric opposition between christianity and judaism softened in the 20th century largely due to a new edition of the bible the skull field bible an annotated version of the bible meaning including commentary and notes alongside the scriptures published by cyrus scoffield in 1909 which changed the view many christians have towards jews and judaism it eased the tensions between the two groups by convincing christians that god commands their uncritical support of the state of israel and turned most american evangelicals into zionists people who support israel as a homeland exclusively for jewish people and now put jews on a pedestal as god 's chosen people or the apple of god 's eye this despite jews not believing in jesus as the son of god and most ethnic jews not even being religious at all all the bible makes it clear that god 's covenant is with those who have faith in christ those who believe in jesus not people who happen to belong to a certain ethnic group even if at one point in history god issued them the ten commandments of course you are not going to hear this in most mainstream christian churches because it 's far too deep down the rabbit hole and the actual truth can be quite offensive to some jews which pastors and corporate churches do not want to risk doing so most of them just give a water down sermon and a generic history lesson about christianity and judaism while carefully avoiding the heart of the matter but this is something i detail in my new book the war on conservatives which you should order at paperback from amazon.com or download the ebook from any of the major ebook stores if you like watching my videos you are really going to love reading my books because these videos are just the tip of the iceberg

today sanders wants to bring what he admired in the ussr cuba nicaragua and other communist states to the united states according to paul sperry and obviously his program for a government spending is extraordinarily ambitious to put it kindly but do not do not just ask me about it ask bernie about it back in 1986 bernie suggested that jfk 's response to the rise of the castro 's made him want to puke that would be the castros who were busy shooting dissidents in the streets jailing them and then imposing communal land ownership and wrecking the economy of cuba such that people in 2020 are still driving around chevy 's from the 1950s when they are not at something to float them to the coast of florida kennedy was saying that nixon was too soft on communism may pick up a point that rick was making in cuba we should deal firmly with fidel castro and nixon was playing the role of hey you got to be patient you know you can not do these things you got to negotiate would of course what he was upset about is that secretly they were planning the bay of pigs invasion right then but for security reasons he come it could not come out and say we already planning the destruction of the cuban revolution do not worry about it so he he was too liberal and kennedy was playing the conservator actually you know there when you read novels people say there 's a sick feeling in your stomach usually i am sufficiently unemotional not to be sick but actually got up in the room and almost left the pubic yeah must let the puke when i found out that the united states opposed the communist revolution that ended with the slaughter of people who actually wanted to just keep that property back in the day bernie was also praising breadlines bernie loves bread lines actually right this is the same period where he was explaining that bread bread lines felt good because their lines for bread why should you let that fly into bread it 's like a grocery store bread lines are good you know those whose good masturbation also gulags bernie sanders looks funny sometimes american journalists talk about how country 's people in other countries rich people get food and poor people starve to death like the united states but when they have bread lines everything is great because nobody gets bread but there is a line and i like lines have you ever danced in the conga line have you ever done the macarena let me ask you back have you ever done a proper conga line or a proper macarena you do not see that in the united states well cultural heritage is restricted to the charleston and square dancing have you ever seen such a thing okay back by the way back back then bernie sanders is also praising soviet infrastructure i just love how this entire period of his career has been wiped clean as though he does not believe all these things and when he 's asked about it he does not apologize as you will see in just a moment when bernie sanders is asked to openly about this stuff he does not back off of it it 's not as though bernie has decided that he changed his mind like over the course i listen i have been doing this since i was 17 since the timeout so almost 20 years in that time some of my views have changed some of them moderated some of them become stronger and this happens over time and when i have changed my view on something i tried to be open about the views that have changed and if somebody asks me about it i will say that my views have changed you can find tons of tape of me online talking about this bernie sanders has not changed his views so she was campaigning with trotsky here is bernie sanders talking about soviet infrastructure and the wonders of soviet infrastructure by the way this is like a couple years before the soviet union collapsed because it turns out it was a garbage heap most of the people here also were extremely impressed by their public transportation system the station 's themselves were absolutely beautiful including many works of art chandeliers that were beautiful it was a very very effective system also i was impressed by the youth programs that they have their palaces of of culture for the young people a whole variety of young programs for young people and cultural programs which go far beyond what we do in this country unbelievable cultural programs they teach you to sing about how great stalin was and then also they teach you to dance about how great stalin was and then when you are finished singing and dancing they teach you to recite poetry about how great stalin was its cultural genius over there as opposed to the united states the inventor of jazz rock and roll musical theater movies they have got actual culture over there actual unbelievable great culture and only one flavor of pudding because you only need one flavor pudding and it is not the tapioca bernie sanders again this guy might win the democratic nomination how nuts is 1/4 of the country right now like full - on crazy completely crazy,0.5803,but you do have to have intent you do have to have intent so there has to be a nexus with a current investigation and this is where things get dicey there has to be a nexus with the muller investigation so in other words if trump just decided i am firing robert muller because i do not like the way his tie looks today that 's not obstruction of justice if trump fires robert muller because he wants to obstruct the investigation that 's obstruction of justice maybe although he still has the authority to fire robert muller for any reasons probably more impeachable than even obstruction of justice according to the muller report there must be a nexus with in a current investigation that nexus showing has both subjective and objective components as an objective matter a defendant must act in a manner that is likely to obstruct justice such that the statute excludes defendants who have an evil purpose but use means that would only unnaturally and improbably be successful in other words you have to be effective in your attempts to obstruct justice or at least the attempt must be somehow within the boundaries of reason as a subjective matter the actor must have contemplated a particular foreseeable proceeding in other words again trump must have intent it must have wanted to shut down the muller report because he thought that its result would be bad for him it can not just be that he wants to shut down the muller report because he thinks that the muller report is just a waste of government money for example that 's why there is the element of corruptly in the obstruction of justice law the word corruptly provides the intent element for obstruction of justice it means acting knowingly and dishonestly or with an improper motive the requisite showing is made when a person acted with an intent to obtain an improper advantage for himself or someone else inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others that last phrase is the one that matters inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others as we will see president trump continually tried to interfere with players surrounding the muller investigation without in any underlying way forcing people to lie and he did so not because he wanted in my opinion and in the opinion of attorney general barr not because he wanted to shut down or obstruct the muller investigation but because he found the entire thing embarrassing and he was attempting to avoid press embarrassment for the most part the most damaging section of the obstruction statute is witnessed tampering a more specific provision in section of 1512 according to the muller report prohibits tampering with a witness that would make it a crime to knowingly use intimidation or corruptly persuade another person or engage in misleading conduct toward another person with intent to influence delay or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding to hinder delay or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer as we will see there 's behavior that verges on this but does not actually cross over into that boundary and finally there 's the question of the attempt is there attempt at obstruction of justice muller says yes he says that the section includes attempt so if you try to obstruct justice but you fail then that could theoretically be obstruction of justice now the reason that he lays out this interpretation of the law is because trump 's activity could legitimately be interpreted in a couple of different ways on the one hand it could be interpreted as president trump trying to actively obstruct the moller investigation because he do not want criminal activity to be uncovered by the muller investigation possibility number two is that trump is a very frustrated guy who spends a lot of time doing immoral bad things and then does more immoral bad but non criminal things in order to cover up the original things that he did so looks sort of like the stormy daniel scandal in other words strips a pornstar it 's embarrassing and immoral it is not criminal and then he does something even more embarrassing and immoral but not criminal he then pays her off to keep her silent just before an election this is the pattern for trump so you can interpret his activities in one of two ways attorney general bar i think properly interprets trump 's activities in the second way that i named and he especially does that in light of the fact that if he had attempted to prosecute trump under obstruction of justice he would have to prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt that would not have happened here whether you are on the left or the right you can think the president did something criminal there is no prosecutor who would have taken up this case here 's a difference between the hillary clinton case and the donald trump case in the hillary clinton case intent was not an element of the crime if you expose classified information to public scrutiny by creating a server and put in classified documents on it that is in and of itself a crime there 's no intent necessary that 's why it was ridiculous when james comey than the head of the fbi said that hillary had not committed a criminal act because she lacked the requisite intent there is no requisite intent it 's a strict liability crime there is no requisite intent in that section of the law there is requisite intent when it comes to obstruction of justice so the reason i am laying all this forth is because that 's where attorney general barr is going when he says that the president and the president emotion matter he says the reason he invoked that is because that stuff is in the report because it is relevant to determining whether he had the requisite intent to commit obstruction of justice in his emotions,0.2873,clarence thomas samuel alito brett kavanaugh and neil gorsuch would 've upheld that louisiana law chief justice roberts sided with the courts for liberals claiming his hands were tied by precedent in the 2016 case whole women 's health versus heller said the court ruled five three against a texas abortion law that required abortion providers have admitting at a hospital within 30 miles states routinely imposed such requirements on the practice of medicine especially invasive or surgical procedures as justice gorsuch observed in that case louisiana law or in this case tracks a long - standing state laws governing physicians who perform relatively low - risk procedures like colonoscopies lasik eye surgeries and steroid injections at ambulatory surgical centers the court in both of these cases the 2016 case on the texas law and the case yesterday on louisiana law ruled quote and unnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose in and do an undue burden on the right to an abortion but what the court defines is an unnecessary requirement would be uncontroversial illegal for any other medical procedure under the sun and of course there is no constitutional right to abortion it just does not exist now normally if you vote one case four years ago one way you do not switch and vote the other way in the exact same case four years later but justice roberts gave the liberals the deference they would not apply themselves writing i joined the dissent in whole women 's health and continue to believe the case was wrongly decided the question today is not whether a whole woman 's health was right or wrong but whether to adhere to it the legal doctrine of stare decisis requires us absent special circumstances to treat like cases alike except for the fact that the whole woman 's health decision overturned a prior decision that had already said the opposite right the the four liberals allowed to do over in the whole women 's health case justice alito pointed out that the whole woman 's health decision disregarded basic rules and apply in all other cases sorry decisis is supposed to promote stability in law by adhering to consistent and predictable rules but the opinions striking down louisiana law do not do any of that stuff robertson joined the majority opinion which is written by justice breyer but by joining its outcome he prevented the courts conservatives from doing anything to keep the court i am constantly rewriting its own rules this is the point that is being made here by zandt mclaughlin and national review abortion law is governed by a 1992 decision while planned parenthood versus casey one of the worst cases in supreme court history in which the court declared that people have a right to define the world and the universe for themselves i mean i am not kidding that 's actually the language of the decision as roberts noted casey asks whether an abortion law imposes an undue burden for the court in whole woman 's health and the plurality today changed the rule to make it a ban test that reviews the pros and cons of the law roberts reiterated that whole women 's health therefore departs from casey and asks the court to apply a test they are not competent to administer this is again in roberts 's opinion quote in this context courts applying a balancing test would be asked in essence to weigh the state 's interests in protecting the potentiality of human life and the health of the woman on one hand against the woman 's liberty interest in defining her own concept of existence of meaning of the universe and of the mystery of human life on the other and that is that that quote is from planned pethood versus case that 's quite i was referring to which is just idiotic there 's no plausible sense in which anyone let alone this court could objectively assign weights to such imponderable values at no meaningful way to compare them if there were attempting to do so would be like judging whether a particular line is longer than a particular rock is heavy that 's what justice ansel and antonin scalia said in planned parenthood versus kc pretending we could pull that off would require us to act as legislators not judges we have explained the traditional rule that state and federal legislatures have wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty is consistent with cacey right that that last line is pretty poignant,0.7261,so what exactly is your excuse i made the switch you can keep your number keep your phone or get huge discounts on the latest iphones and androids and unlimited talk texts six gigs of

street journal the latest that a russian airstrike on a ukrainian military training center close to the polish border threw into sharp relief the hazards of the western push to deliver arms support to kiev while avoiding direct conflict with a nuclear adversary the airstrike killed 35 people at the facility in yavariv about 10 miles from the polish border early on sunday far to the west where the conflict has been concentrated if you look at the map you can see the kia this sort of two - thirds of the way west of the eastern boundary of ukraine and this particular facility is right on the border it 's one day after moscow warned the west who would consider arms deliveries to ukraine as legitimate targets a large portion of the military aid from the west passes through poland into western ukraine part of the fine line the u.s and nato are walking between aiding ukraine militarily while steering clear of providing troops or enforcing a no - fly zone that ukraine has called for the expansion of russia 's aggression to a target close to poland also increases the risk of war encroaching on nato territory which the united states has already warned would be treated as an attack on the alliance any strike on poland would bring the full force of the nato alliance to bear in responding to it according to jake sullivan the u.s national security adviser so right now the question is what exactly are the russians doing and the answer of course is that the russians are ratcheting things up they are attempting to pressure the west into cracking they see cracks in the western alliance as far as how far the west is willing to go they see vulnerabilities and they are currently seeking to exploit those vulnerabilities what they understand is that if they pressure the west enough into not giving ukraine the kind of support it needs the high likelihood at that point is that zilenski makes the sorts of concessions the west does not like but that do preserve zalenski in power in ukraine while limiting what he can actually do on behalf of ukraine what russia is asking for right now demanding not asking for since they have 200 000 troops in country what they are demanding is that ukraine recognize as independent the breakaway regions of donetsk and luhansk over in the eastern part of ukraine that they recognize the russian annexation of crimea which has been a long - standing russian demand because the majority of crimea are russian - speaking people they held a plenum in 2014 it was an election that was not particularly clean in which the people of crimea supposedly voted to join russia in all likelihood the reality is that if you held a clean election it 's possible maybe probable that crimea votes to join russia anyway although in the aftermath of this particular attack it 's it 's possible that that goes the other way in any case what russia 's demanding is that those breakaway regions which were essentially seeded by vladimir putin by putting his so - called little green men inside to start some sort of insurrectionary war against the ukrainian government and then create breakaway provinces that would join with russia in foreign policy that ukraine recognized that it does not have any control over those regions they also want ukraine to say that it will never join nato or join the eu those are the big things those are the big asks and demands from the russian government and the longer this war goes on and the more weakness the west shows the more likely zalensky 's going to say to the west listen you guys are more than happy to see this this war go on with ukrainian bodies in the streets but you are not willing to give us the kind of support that would be actually necessary to beat the russians back to russia all you really want to see is us continue to resist but not strongly enough that it would trigger a larger war and say you know what i am not up for that i am going to give them what the reality on the ground already is then i am going to say that we won because we preserved ukraine 's independence from russia even if we had to make some concessions but the truth is you were not letting us into the eu,0.6146,it 's annoying eny let me let this finish you are seeing evidence of that uh at the naval observatory the residence of the vice president kla harris right now quote unquote borders are vice president harris was not a bordar meantime vice president and borders are kamla harris facing some backlash what he said about harris and immigration was not true she was never appointed borders ar and this will be her first visit to the uh us mexico border region since she was appointed as the borders are by president biden people going have to counter the misinformation you already hear folks talking about the bordar she was not the bordar president biden tapped kamla harris vice president kla harris to be the bordar now she was not the borders are that 's what republicans uh labeled her they were very critical of kamla harris especially in her role as border zar now what she 's up against is folks lying about her border record calling her a border zar kla harris who was appointed as the borders are the biden team do not declare her the borders are they wanted her to work on kind of the root causes of immigration there has been so much ism against kla harris you know she was the border zar calling her sort of the border zar which was not necessarily the case so the border if they were not planning to address it in a major way do not make her your borders are she met with some of the northern triangle countries but nothing has effectively changed it 's crazy,0.4611,i am not telling you to buy coins i am not doing any of that i am saying that the idea that there is a competitive market for currency is an indictment of the dollar and it should be an indictment of the dollar we are at $ 35 trillion in debt whether we like it or not whether you like it or not crypto is happening and donald trump is on the right side of crypto and at the baseline of crypto one of the reasons why kamla harris does not embrace crypto is because she 's controlled by elizabeth warren who is controlled by the big banks that 's right elizabeth warren is actually controlled by the big banks because elizabeth warren does not want small banks she wants three or four national fascistic run banks kamla harris does not embrace bitcoin because it is too liberating bitcoin is empowering bitcoin is a decentralized way that everyday patriots can build wealth store wealth transfer wealth without big daddy government monitoring infiltrating observing or preventing your god - given right to own private property the new york times had it best from believers to bitcoin 24 hours in trump 's code switching campaign when donald j trump tries to win over a crowd that is not inherently his own it goes on from there let us continue from his bitcoin conference play cut seven those who say that bitcoin is a threat to the dollar have the story exactly backwards i believe it is exactly backwards bitcoin is not threatening the dollar the beh behavior of the current us government is really threatening the dollar the danger to our financial future does not come from crypto it comes from washington dc it comes from trillions of dollars in waste rampant inflation and open borders while giving welfare and free health care to all of the illegal aliens that are pouring into our country by the millions and millions and millions it comes from printing hundreds of billions of dollars to fund endless wars overseas while our cities are like combat zones here at home he continued by saying i will immediately order the treasury department and other federal agencies to cease and desist all steps towards the creation of a central bank digital currency i sure hope president trump 's security is better than it has been,0.6642,is [ music ] now sit back and i am going to tell you a story

forward toward the toward the reopening of places like italy and denmark you are starting to see a second wave in asia according to the economic times the japanese government may declare a state of emergency this week to contain a a virus outbreak shinzo abe a the prime minister is reportedly set to make a declaration for parts of japan including tokyo as the number of people infected with the virus continues to increase the news pushed up tokyo stocked with investors seemed to move as a positive for containing the outbreak authorities reported 120 new virus cases on sunday so they are declaring an emergency in japan which until now had been fairly non hard - hit also in singapore they have been relocking down in particular areas that are locking down dormitory complexes because people are coming in and reinfecting everybody so the big question is what happens when you start to open this thing back up meanwhile italy in norway are beginning to look at easing their lock downs after denmark and austria became the first two european countries to loosen restrictions as governments seek to gradually revive economies crippled by the containment measures without risking a second wave of infections according to bloomberg italy the original epicenter of the outbreak has begun to plan for merging from the lockdown selected firms could open in mid - april according to an official familiar with the discussions norway may also move to ease restrictions with a press briefing scheduled later on tuesday parts of italy 's agribusiness and health sectors and mechanical equipment companies linked to those industries could be allowed to restart operations the protection for workers will be critical for each company involved said a person who was talking on condition of anonymity after weeks of measures designed to limit contact between people european governments are seeing growing evidence that shutting down much of modern life is containing the disease but the scale of the outbreak means officials need to weigh any attempts to restart parts of the economy against the risk of reigniting the spread europe has been hard hit his hardest hit by the pandemic denmark is going to press ahead with cautious reopening they are going to start with daycare and primary schools on april 15th if the virus numbers remain stable the government will also start talks with business leaders on gradually moving employees back into offices but with some restrictions in place for months to come so this is where the rubbers going to hit the road it will be fascinating to see what happens in these countries where they go back to some level of reopening now people are all over sweden because sweden has basically allowed people to continue going to restaurants you just do not go to the counter instead you sit at your table and your social distance they have allowed people to continue going to work they have kept their schools open and so they have seen a jump in deaths but we are not going to know again the counterfactual which is if they had locked everybody home for a year was that going to be better was that actually going to turn out better again if the models are trying to tell that over the next few months you are less likely to die if you stay home that is true if the models are telling you that over the course of the next year you have precisely the same chance of dying if you go out as staying in and everybody is just going to go out and that remains the question that no one is willing to answer what happens with this second wave once you got the guys to use in place once you have the ventilators in place once you have tested all the drugs that you can test at least for them for a moment then why are we not going to a system where the people who are the most vulnerable namely the oldest of people have pre - existing conditions why are we not moving to a system where those people are basically quarantined off for self quarantine until we have a vaccine and everybody else who is much lower risk goes back to work because one of the things that we have been seeing even in new york city is that the the people who are dying of corona almost entirely have pre - existing conditions and we are seeing the data in that the data are are fairly clear at this point which is that the if you are older you have a significantly higher rate of death if you have a pre - existing condition you have significantly a higher rate of death you can see this this all these this information is indeed available from the new york city government the new york city government is reporting in terms of rates by age per 100,000 people if you are 75 and older this is kovan 19 acquisition if you have co2 the rate that is so far measured and again the rates not perfect because the testing is not perfect if you are 75 and older then out of a hundred thousand people you have about 1.3 percent chance if you are 75 and older of having coronavirus 1.25 percent chance if you are 65 to 74 1.2 percent chance if you are 45 to 64 a point 7 percent chance if you are 18 to 44 and you have a point 6 9 percent chance if you are 0 to 17 and if you look at pre - existing conditions you will see that the the number of people with pre - existing conditions is it is fairly obvious that people have tremendous underlying conditions and if you are typically going to die",0.4863,lots of them are when they start you can not be an expert in anything at that age you certainly are not going to be an expert in teaching kids who are barely younger than yourself so swallow well is wrong on every level and from every conceivable angle as per usual but the interesting point is that he came out explicitly against parental rights just a day or two after the election the left has gotten even bolder than usual over the past several days having decided that the results of the midterms vindicate and validate all of their most extreme talking points this conclusion is of course erroneous especially when it comes to parental rights of all issues in fact republicans up the ballot may have fared relatively poorly in most states but as we talked about last week conservatives and school board races were much more successful the daily wire reports quote this week conservatives flipped at least nine school boards in at least six states michigan maryland north carolina south carolina new jersey and florida giving them conservative majorities according to two parental rights groups who endorsed many of the victorious candidates the wind signal that parental rights were a significant factor at the ballot box on tuesday in michigan four school board candidates in brandywine who were endorsed by a parents right group rights group called 1776 project pa pack won their races flipping the board from liberal to conservative in maryland three of their school board candidates one in carroll county flipping the school board there to a conservative majority the 76 1776 project pack claims that it has um officially flipped 100 school boards since november last year the group 's candidates also won in oklahoma and ohio another parents rights group moms for liberty told the daily wire that it notched clusters of winds in at least four states the group flipped at least seven school boards in north carolina conservative candidates won in both new hanover county and iredale county flipping both of those school board boards conservatives in south carolina six conservative candidates one in berkeley county 5 - 1 in charleston county and another 4 - 1 in york county flipping all three school board to the conservative side moms for liberty also said that in new jersey three candidates in cape may county won their elections flipping that school board conservative in florida two candidates one in pinellas county flipping that board conservative as well so in other words the left decides at its own peril that parents groups and parents rights are a losing political issue the results indicate actually the exactly the opposite of that republicans only lost on the issue of parental rights if they chose not to run on it in the first place and many of them made that choice you can not win the argument if you do not make the argument and the argument for parental rights is very easy to make and it will automatically resonate with the vast majority of parents that 's the thing about us parents whether we identify with the political left or right we do not like it when someone tries to parent our children for us somebody should tell that to the national education association teachers union which also decided after the election that they now have political permission to explicitly attack parental rights so on friday the nea tweeted this quote educators love their students and know better than anyone what they need to learn and to thrive better than anyone they say now the phrasing there is quite deliberate obviously the teachers union is claiming that teachers know better than parents what their children need but that is of course exactly wrong it is the opposite of reality in fact the very best argument for homeschooling is that parents not public school teachers are experts in the most important field now most parents just as most teachers do not have phds in math or science or any other academic discipline but they are experts on one thing which is their children they are experts on their children parents know or should know their own children better than anyone so the nea accidentally raises a good point here the most effective educator is going to be the person who knows the child best to understands him who knows what he needs and can tailor the education to fit those needs and that last step is very important because even if a public school teacher does come to understand a child 's educational needs which is a big if considering that the teacher will likely have 20 or 30 other students in the class only about 45 minutes in a day to teach them any given subject so it 's very difficult to get to know any of the kids but but even if the teacher does um he 's not going to have he will have only a very limited ability to respond to the child 's needs even if the teacher comes to understand what those needs are a teacher can not give 30 different kids their own personalized and customized educational environment it 's impossible and that 's not because of the teacher 's personal limitations but rather it 's because of the way the system is set up a worker on an assembly line probably does not have probably does not have the ability to make the product by hand but even if he does he can not do that while working on the assembly line the public school system is an assembly line the teachers are simply manning their stations along the conveyor belt and even if they man them well and many of them do there 's only so much attention they can give to each child as he is ferried on down the line,0.5279,yet just a handful of years later in 1872 the texas supreme court denied that there was any right to carry any weapon for self - defense in either constitution and either the federal constitution or in the state constitution and you know how they defended that decision they do not they offered absolutely no explanation whatsoever i wonder what changed between 1859 and 1872 1859 one year before the civil war in eighteen seventy two seven years after the civil war what what what what changed about the ability to keep and bear arms so the nra how was it founded was founded in 1871 by union soldiers not by those nefarious racists by the people who fought a bloody bloody war to free the slaves i was first charted in new york in 1871 the first president of the nra was the union general ambrose burnside fresh off of freeing all the slaves and reuniting the union the nra s 8th president was u.s . grant ulysses s grant president of both the united states and the nra and a great defender of civil rights and defeater of southern secessionists slavers the nra was founded at actually not initially just to lobby congress or lobby for good gun laws because gun control was a regional issue that clearly at this time was used mostly to oppress blacks it was actually founded because the union troops were terrible shots so the union troops were firing something like a thousand rifle rounds for each confederate they hit they were not very good at shooting so it was founded to give people like the union troops who defended ordered liberty and defended human dignity better training now that there is this a crazy aspect since the shooting in florida people are saying what we need to do is have mandatory training so they want all these things they want to ban certain guns they want to raise the age they basically just want fewer people to have guns they say we need mandatory gun training this does not make any sense at all what you are saying is that the way to prevent a mass shooting like we saw in florida is to train the people to be better shots they want to train mass shooters to be better at shooting guns it does not make any sense and first of all the nra already offers training and it has for 150 years why would mandatory training be the solution to mass shooters mandatory training for a lot of other people giving guns to more people allowing guns to be easier to be had and having the good guys trained to use guns that would be good but really we should borrow the bad guys from from training in general it 's a total deflection though it 's just one of these empty points it 's they throw spaghetti at the wall because they do not like guns they do not want you to have guns and they are going to use any argument no matter how tenuous it is to try to take guns away from you do you remember democrats who rode around in white sheets lynching the blacks they were able to do that because white democrats had already taken the guns away from blacks the special report of the paris anti - slavery conference of 1867 found as much they concluded the freedmen in the south quote were forbidden to own or bear firearms and thus were rendered defenseless against assault speaking of very important supreme court decisions albion tourgee a the civil rights attorney who represented plessy in plessy v ferguson in 1896,0.5475
but you know idea you know those are completely idiotic things and you know people are saying you know the video games contribute to violent video games make people you know kill others you know it 's the same nonsense as people saying guns make people kill others or violent video games or violent movies or just portrays of violent imagery helps or contributes to violence and also the nonsense that people on you know the feminist agenda pushing now or they are saying things like you know curvy bodies and video game characters there you know nice butts and you know volleyball games are you know contributing to misogyny or internalized sexism it all that bs you know that 's you know we never at violence or misogyny before video games and movies exactly it never existed in fact you know it,0.1054,it 's obvious that the news media has been waging a disinformation war against president trump since the day he won the 2016 election something i chronicled in my book the true story of fake news but the entertainment industry has also dedicated much of their creative efforts to continuously casting him and everything he does in a negative light by weaving anti - trump narratives into the plot lines of countless television dramas and sitcoms to ensure that as many people as possible are inundated with the message stephen colbert went so far as to produce an entire animated series for hbo called our cartoon president which is dedicated to mocking him before becoming president the media used to love donald trump for decades he was a symbol of wealth and success and throughout the 1980s and 90s made cameos in dozens of tv shows and movies like the fresh prince of bel air spin city wrestlemania home loan 2 zoolander and more but all that changed after the 2016 election when the liberal media industrial complex launched a war against him hoping to derail his administration and prevent him from cleaning up the corruption in washington d.c and bringing the government gravy train to a halt abc 's sitcom black - ish revolves around an african - american family and the issues that they face as a black middle - class family in america today and shortly after the 2016 election there was an episode about how terrified everyone was about trump 's victory and how awful it would be for black people for his entire professional life donald trump has been a friend of the black community and had been given awards for all that he did every leader in the black community from jesse jackson to al sharpton to muhammad ali had sung praises of him for decades but as soon as he came close to becoming the president the media started gaslighting how racist he was hoping to get black people to turn against him in an episode of the simpsons homer and lisa walked past a tv news crew that 's interviewing a group of men one of them wearing a red maga hat and kent brockman the reporter then says that he 's speaking with three blue - collar men who voted for trump and asked them how they feel and one of them replies please stop interviewing us as if he 's ashamed that he voted for president trump but realized that he made a big mistake kent brockman here interviewing three blue - collar men who voted for trump how do you feel now please stop interviewing us never in an episode of the revived murphy brown series a character who was a reporter and the show was depicted as being attacked by a group of rabid trump supporters because of their hatred of the media while promoting the show candice bergen who plays murphy brown said that donald trump winning in 2016 was the motivation to bring the show back the original series which aired from 1988 to 1998 depicted murphy brown as an investigative journalist and a news anchor so producers thought with president trump 's war on media raging they could bring the show back and have murphy brown working to expose him when nbc brought back will and grace in 2017 after initially ending the series in 2006 one episode depicted a character walking into a cake shop because she was hosting a birthday party for the president and wanted a cake that said make america great again on it and while ordering she makes a comment about how she will be serving white russians at the party a reference of course to the democrats obsession with the trump campaign supposedly in their brain dead mind conspiring with the russians to steal the 2016 election adding that she could not reveal who was on the guest list because well you know why the baker then refused to bake the cake saying that the phrase make america great again is racist even the x - files has included anti - trump messages the series which originally aired from 1993 to 2002 was revived in 2016 for a few more seasons and in the january 2018 season premiere when it kicked off the cigarette smoking man started narrating footage of president trump 's inauguration which then cuts to a montage of clips including vladimir putin and americans at voting booths while he talks about the horrible state of the country in one episode mulder discovers that someone trying to silence him is a russian contractor who was given special security clearance by the executive branch of the government insinuating of course that the president is trying to get him whacked as you know every few months throughout the first term of the trump administration the mainstream media repeated the same news cycle about the possibility that president trump may be removed from office by enacting the 25th amendment which allows the expulsion of the president if the majority of the cabinet agreed that he 's mentally unfit for office which would result in the vice president taking over and such pipe dreams have been fueled by the gossip columnist michael wolff and his tabloid trash books that were of course hailed by the mainstream media for his supposed anonymous sources inside the white house who said that the possibility was being discussed every day the lefts to desperate hope that the 25th amendment could end their trump nightmare caused the issue to get written into the plots of various political dramas on television allowing those with trump derangement syndrome to have the emotional satisfaction for a fleeting moment that it had actually happened and these plots really served to plant seeds in people 's minds in the audience hoping that they would grow to increase the discussions and the pressure about actually doing such thing to president trump the showtime series homeland a spy thriller about the department of homeland security is just one of numerous shows to include this plot point before president trump such a topic was never addressed in a political drama or thriller the 25th amendment was just an obscure provision few people had ever heard of,0.3592,news organizations started saying that this guy jeremy christian is a known white nationalist unknown white supremacist who was attending all right free speech rallies they pegged this to islamophobia coming from a trump supporting white supremacist who killed two good samaritans but the story was very controversial it turns out this guy jeremy christian was an ardent bernie sanders jill stein supporter he had posted how he wanted to kill trump and hillary voters his stance on many of these issues are not too clear to make matters worse the news organizations showing these photos of german christian giving a nazi salute and attending this free speech rally one of these photos is actually him being removed from the rally by the free speech rally attendees because they do not want him there as he was spewing racial slurs and giving the nazi salute this guy was actually removed from the rally so to say that he has a trump supporting white nationalist who attended his rallies is a bit disingenuous the issue is a bit more complicated than that there 's a post circulating where it appears jeremy christians intent on going to the free speech rally was a sort of false flag he called it a psyop the idea was he would go there and say racial slurs and given obviously because he knew he would be removed thus proving that the free speech rally do not really believe in free speech and that maybe what happened but then we see news organizations use this to prove that he was actually aligned with trump supporters conservatives and people attending the free speech rally it may not be the case but the situation is very complicated this guy jeremy christian is an ardent free speech supporter and he does oppose antifa so some of his interests are aligned with some people on the right though he voted for bernie sanders and posted on facebook how he could not bring himself to vote for trump it 's not clear you can not just say this guy is a trump supporting all right white nationalist it 's more nuanced than that but now because of this incident the mayor of portland is calling on the federal government to shut down this free speech rally they want to revoke the permit of this free speech rally happening in portland on sunday the mayor of portland said that he will not and did not issue a permit for this event that their city is in mourning and that hate speech is not protected by the first amendment now as many people have pointed out including journalists the washington post and the aclu hate speech is in fact protected by the first amendment the supreme court has ruled repeatedly that no matter how hateful bigoted or just mean - spirited and awful your speeches it is protected under the first amendment unless there is a clear and present danger or you are inciting people to violence this that simply because there is a controversial moment the event is allowed to continue taking place and the mayor of portland has no right to call for its being shut down the aclu said that the mayor should have had a private meeting with the rally organizers and asked them to either cancel or postpone and due to the murders that just happened recently instead the mayor 's call to shut down the rally has just invigorated people and now i am hearing there are many more people who are interested in what 's happening there people from the east coast planning on flying out this might turn in something large because the mayor calls for the event to be shut down it 's almost like a streisand effect that because the mayor tried to shut this event down people are even more interested in attending now portland is considered a very progressive left - leaning place there are a lot of communists socialists activists and a lot of people who engage in what 's called a black bloc tactic as where they wear all black masks and you see a lot of vandalism coming from these groups there tends to be a lot of violence like we saw in berkeley with auntie fun they are all wearing black hoods mask glasses then from explosives into crowds recently a man called the bike lock basher eric clanton had bashed seven people over the head with a bike lock and this was one of the antiva protesters many of those people in berkeley are believed to have come from the northwest including seattle in portland that being the case many people are worried that there will be violence at this rally one of the concerns of the city is that not only is it a political issue where the city is mourning after these two men were killed but that the potential for violence is there and the event probably should not happen however counter protesters are saying that they do not want to engage in violence and they are calling on people not to engage in vandalism a few organizers of the counter protest said that although they respect other groups rights to autonomy and what they call a diversity of tactics they are requesting people not to engage in violence or vandalism because at this point it will only hurt their cause but at the same flyers have started going up depicting donald trump having his head cut in half by a chainsaw where it says not one inch activists are calling for militant trainings so that people can be prepared to fight back but as it goes both factions truly believe the defending themselves i will say in my experience say at the berkeley event or at many of these trump rallies it does tend to be the counter protests that get angry and incite violence not always but it does tend to be the case if even a little bit the reality here is that the situation is significantly more nuanced than most people seem to know or even want to know the event is probably going to happen and i am going to go and cover it this is not just another small partisan conflict this has captured national attention because of what happened with jeremy christian and these two men so we do have something here that may shape public discourse depending on what happens in portland and i will be flying out hopefully in the next day or so to get some on - the - ground interviews before the event and then livestream the event as it takes place so stay tuned comment below and let me know what you think what do you think is going to happen it 's really hard to predict they there are many activists saying keep calm no violence please it 's going to disrupt the message but there are activists calling for militant training with violent pictures pictures of knives things could get really rowdy or they could be really calm but aside from that should the event take place other than that you can click the like button it really does help out the channel it tells youtube that my channel is good and that youtube should show it to more people subscribe for new videos every day at 4:00 p.m. and stay tuned i will be in portland soon i will see you all tomorrow,0.1663,okay the simple fact of the matter is when you get rid of the cops there are serious costs to that particularly to the most vulnerable story from black enterprise.com today the area where george floyd lost his life on may 25 2020 has become a combination of a healing ground memorial protest location a reminder of needed police reform despite the presence of fresh flowers and vibrant memorial art barricades marked boundaries trash must be cleaned people gather at the place making headlines some of them come from near and far business owners also want others to remember the economic justice elements of their plate they once owned thriving businesses now they do not now you have to wonder yourself wait a second if this place became like a sacred visiting spot would not that generate some business the answer of course is no the memorial area is located at the intersection of east 38th street and chicago avenue in minneapolis tucked inside a neighborhood where people must also live and make a living people are still coming to the area known as george floyd 's square mainly to pay homage to floyd the starts were being reported that hundreds of people trickled into the square to hear and celebrate the chauvin verdict earlier this week however black - owned businesses were established there before floyd was killed and now they are struggling according to the new york post report at least five stores along one block are now shuttered following the killing of floyd carjackings have nearly tripled cars are being stolen at high rates police presence has also been reduced that 's one way to phrase it black enterprise.com how about police presence was reduced therefore carjackings have nearly tripled and cars are being stolen at high rates black merchants said the police have abandoned the blocked off intersection while creating a dangerous autonomous zone that has seen crime spike and businesses evaporate the new york post reported on thursday the intersection was essentially abandoned save for the occasional walker who posed for photos in front of a mural outside cup foods the convenience store floyd allegedly passed a counterfeit 20 bill so all the businesses in the area are dying because it turns out that your garbage policy has pretty garbage consequences does not matter the media and democrats are going to push forward with their world - breaking utopian change anyway according to the washington post quote after the chauvin verdict minneapolis activists fuel up and prepare for the long fight ahead according to the washington post when the chauvin trial verdict while the chauvin trial verdict is viewed as a victory by activists many in minneapolis are emphasizing the conviction of one white officer does not mean the fight is over nor does it erase what they see as systemic racism in policing or other areas of american life justice for floyd is not final either three other former minneapolis police officers who were at the scene that night are awaiting trial on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter in floyd 's killing prosecutors are going to try to reinstate third degree murder charges against each before their trial in august so the three guys who just were there now those guys are going to be charged for three third degree murder and it 's not just that it 's amid a backdrop that many activists said the battle for racial equality and justice has a long way to go and what do they want they want to get rid of the cops they want to they want to crack down on the ability of police officers to do their jobs and the media are treating every incident now every single incident of violence with regard to a black suspect as an incident of police misconduct so for example abc world news tonight continues to push the case of makia bryant a case in which a police officer saved the life of a black girl by shooting a black girl wielding a knife at her they are treating that case as somehow controversial policing here 's abc world news tonight tonight growing cries to re - evaluate police use of force policies in the wake of the shooting death of ohio 16 year old mikaya bryant we recently had shooting after shooting after shooting so maybe the training is wrong protesters hitting the streets again today the fifth straight day since the shooting happened bryant 's family telling me the police need to change they have the power right now to put some changes in the book just unbelievable the situation we have to be able to do better and protecting uh life i have a question where was makia brian 's family throughout this entire debacle considering she was living in a foster home at the time that all this happened like where were all these family members who actually you know take care of mickey o'brien when she was alive and protect her from this situation that she was involved in where it 's amazing how everybody 's out of the woodwork talking about how the cops are at fault when the family members are completely absent to the point where this woman 's this young girl she was not a woman she 's 16 was in a foster home,0.5406,it 's presumptuous to try to improve on tip o'neill who said all politics is personal i have become convinced from watching you over 40 years all international politics is ultimately personal if you can not establish a personal relationship you do not have to love one another if you can not establish a personal relationship where you understand one another it 's awfully hard to get anything done i had the opportunity of traveling from beijing to chengdu and every other place in between with the hospitality of the of the president we had more hours of dinners alone than i think he ever anticipated joe biden 's dealings with the chinese go back long before he was the vice president remember how long biden has been working in washington this man served in the senate for over three decades he was also head of the senate foreign relations committee where joe biden also ran up against china and other american adversaries so joe biden 's experience of china does not only begin when he is vice president of the united states and he winds up taking his son hunter biden on air force two for an official trip [ music ] remember that only months before the november 2020 election america 's mainstream media censored a substantiated story showing hunter biden 's involvement in major business deals with china one email confirmed as real by one of biden 's former business partners read tan held by h for the big guy translation ten percent for joe biden held by hunter one email found on hunter 's abandoned laptop described a deal with chinese businessman who according to hunter biden were tied to chinese intelligence it appears that means the current president of the united states was taking a ten percent cut from chinese businessmen connected to chinese intelligence services the rest of the elite rose as of a single organism to defend him to protect him to protect him from news of scandals within his own family and it 's important to note the relationships with the chinese communist party were not just hunter biden in a sense the biden family is thrown hunter the troubled son to the wolves we really want to look at different people who are managing relationships for the biden family in the biden family it 's important to look at joe biden 's brother jim remember he 's the one who was actually establishing the relationship with chinese officials and we learned that in 2016 while joe biden was vice president an investment firm founded by hunter biden with chinese partners was part of a 3.8 billion dollar deal that transferred a critical cobalt mine from an american company to a chinese company why in 2013 did 43 year old hunter biden accompany his father the vice president of the united states on an official state visit to china was he there to soak in the views and enjoy quality family time with his father or could have had something to do with the private equity fund that hunter founded with his chinese partners china wants a comprehensive picture of everything they want to understand charts and graphs of human networks inside of washington and throughout the united states they want to know precisely who our elites are and who they work and how they operate because they want to know who is connected to whom what pressure can you put on this person to get a response from this other person and this is one of the reasons why the chinese would go out of their way to work with hunter biden jim biden and of course joe biden even when it appeared in 2017 that joe biden was not going to run for president of the united states before anyone had a clear idea of that the chinese were out there already working that angle beijing casts a wide net and sometimes finds that those swept up may someday be useful,0.5807,"but now this seems to be all about politics what do you say about that you know you have innocent children in pales palestinians who are dying innocent israeli children who are dying and no one seems to be able to say enough stop that i am not interested in politics at all uh my only concern is getting emily back and this is insane the media are literally trying to push a man whose daughter is being held hostage by a terrorist group into saying that israel is doing the wrong thing by going after the terrorist group not seeing that sign from gail king right there that bring back our our babies sign not seeing it so here 's the thing there 's tons of jew hatred on planet earth

only way to read this so joe biden just greenlit 10 billion being handed over to iran late on tuesday the secretary of state sent to congress a recommendation for a 120 - day waiver allowing the iraqi government to transfer 1010 billion in frozen funds to the ayatollah in iran the capital was irach his payments for iranian electricity but is being held in an escrow account the administration says the waiver was necessary to preserve rocks electricity supplies but uh that means that they are just going to use all that money for terrorism because that is what they doing so the united states has been under attack from terrorist militia groups throughout the middle east mostly controlled by iran on 56 occasions us positions in iraq and syria are now under attack from the iranians 59 us service personnel have been injured in those strikes and uh joe biden is signing waivers to transfer billions of dollars to the iranian government even as the iranian government is weak the iranian government has been tremendously weakened there 's a report yesterday out of iran international english that actually the iran supreme leader alii one of the aas he delivered a clear message to kamas leader isma hania he said we were not warned about your attack and um we love you and you are best friends but high five is you drown which makes perfect sense you as i have suggested since the beginning of the war the the most plausible explanation for what actually happened is that iran green lit an attack from kamas in an attempt to scuttle the saudi peace plan that was being put on the table between israel and saudi arabia brokered by the biden administration they wanted to kill that deal so they said to hamas do an attack kill a bunch of jews hope that israel goes in strong and that will scuttle the deal but what they do not count on is kamas being successful enough to kill 12200 people and take 240 hostages necessitating the complete obliteration of kamas they just figured kamas would live to fight another day there would be another ceasefire kamas would continue to maintain its power in the gaza strip so instead of iran gaining the death of the saudi peace plan they got that but they also lost one of their biggest pawns on the board in and then the question became do they wish to lose other pieces on the chess board because the unspoken reality of this current middle east conflict is that the actual serious threat to israel is actually not kamas in the gaza strip right now is hezbollah on israel 's northern border which has 200,000 rockets pointed at israel including 50,000 highly sophisticated rockets capable of geot targeting which means can hit towers in tel aviv not the dumb rockets that are being fired by kamas smart rockets that are being fired from southern lebanon into israel so as we have seen deterrence does not really tend to deter terrorist groups when push comes to shave and so israel at some point is going to have to go after kah the question is whether they are going to do it right now iran does not want them to do it right now because if israel were to swivel and hit kah right now and take them off the table that 's a real problem for iran the forward operating base against israel for iran was hamas in the south andah in the north hamas has been taken off the table if israel takes kah off the table iran that has no projective capability in terms of actually being able to destroy israel they can certainly make trouble on the northern hor they can certainly create problems in judea and samaria the so - called west bank they can certainly do all those things but they do not have an existential threat on israel 's border if israel takes out kah so iran basically is interested in containing this thing because they do not wantah to go down alongside hamas so as iran is in a weakened position it 's very weird that the biden administration continues to fund iran like what exactly is the theory there that they are going to be nice if you give them money that has not worked well in the past are you tired of the lies and the twists of the mainstream media",1.0008,every person except the chicks in the women 's prison apparently uh for the record i watched every episode of orange is the new black and frankly a woman 's prison seems far scarier to me than a men 's prison libby surprise i guess not surprised like what i have talked to i have talked to women who um are out of prison but who were in prison with men i have talked to women who are currently serving time alongside men in the women 's prisons and these are real problems um unfortunately when you bring up something like this why are there men in women 's prisons no one really cares because these women are already at the bottom of society they are women they are criminals they in many cases are poor they were already in many cases subject to domestic abuse and violence um which led in a lot of cases to their arriving in prison in the first place so one woman that i talked to who is currently serving time in the central california women 's correctional facility has told me about when men come into the prisons there they self - id in they are fully intact uh they have not cut off their hot dogs everything 's still perfectly functioning and the the prisons will they will vacate an eight woman cell in order to accommodate one man who will then be housed in that cell they are given roommates um who are women and they end up in many cases in sexual relationships with these women it 's not just abuse and rape but it 's also the entirely changing dynamic that happens when a man a man enters a woman 's face and there 's rivalries and things like this um this woman was also telling me about how a trans inmate impregnated a woman at the prison and then beat her to the point where she miscarried because uh this was not something that they wanted to have exposed and the fetus was uh the miscarried fetus was buried in the prison yard she 's told me that guards are aware of this people are aware of this but no one really wants to talk about it there are women who are advocating for these women who are in prison who are being doubly subjected there this is a cruel and unusual punishment in a lot of cases there 's a man in a california women 's prison who is currently housed with the mother of the children that he um murdered so that 's interesting as well that happens in many cases there 's cases in the uk where women who were raped are forced by judges to refer to their rapists as she because that rape is determined after the rape and while involved in the criminal justice system that actually he is female and this is inflicted upon women and i would like to say we have seen historically and that 's how we ended up with a women 's history month in the first place women are substantially more compliant than men women are raised to be uh you know a little kinder and more compassionate it is easy to push women around we all know we all know this this is not a new phenomenon,0.3134,the polls show that joe biden is losing the 2024 election it 's an unfortunate truth for the incumbent president a series of swing state polls now out from redfield wilton and the telegraph show that donald trump is now in the lead in pennsylvania by two georgia by five michigan by 1 arizona by two north carolina by 3 florida by six meanwhile a new poll from the de moine register an seltzer who is the best pollster in the country she of course has to get it right because the i caucuses are a very important jumping point for every presidential race she 's an a+ pollster meaning she pretty much knows everyone personally in iowa she currently has donald trump up 18 points on joe biden 50 to 32 biden 's net approval is atga - 39 in iowa why does that matter i mean trump won iowa walking away last time he won it by eight not by 18 by eight so there are huge numbers that trump is racking up in places like iowa not just that a new washington post study of the so - called deciders these would be people who turn out who turn out to vote sporadically or who have switched their vote between republican and democrat when it comes to the swing states about 61 % of people declare themselves deciders those would be people who voted in only one of the last couple presidential elections or are between the ages of 18 and 25 or registered to vote since 2022 or who did not definitely plan to vote for either biden or trump this year or switch their support between 2016 and 2020 well among the non deciders in the swing states donald trump is in a very slight lead over joe biden 177 % say that they will definitely vote for trump 15 % say will definitely vote for biden that 's out of a total of 39 % among the non deciders among the deciders these are people who are sporadic voters or uncommitted voters if you look at the uncommitted voters probably trump beats probably biden by a couple of percentage points these are all very close states and what that means that if donald trump is leading among both the deciders and also the non- deciders then he 's just leading overall and right now if you look at this washington post polling data what you see is that among all key state voters 31 % say they would definitely vote for donald trump compared to 26 % who say they would definitely vote for joe biden another 177 % say they would probably vote for donald trump compared to 15 % for joe biden most importantly in terms of who would definitely not vote for or probably not vote for 55 % of voters in the key states say they will either definitely not or probably not vote for joe biden compared to only 49 % for donald trump this means that right now donald trump is pretty obviously winning which again is one of the reasons why the economist which does a forecast on who they believe is going to win currently has donald trump 's chances of winning the election at 72 % which is extraordinary now again you will recall that back in 2016 it was thought that hillary clint had 99 % chance of winning the election and of course she then lost but the bottom line is if you had to put your money on the election today you would be betting on donald trump cnn 's harry enton was stunned yesterday looking at the polling data and seeing what percentage of black voters for example are now examining the possibility of voting for president trump here was harry enton yesterday look at black voters age 50 and older and you will see look joe biden won was leading amongst this group at this point by 83 points back in 2020 now it 's 7 4 points,0.3046,[ music ] today i want to present to you some of the things i have been thinking and writing about as easter approached i am going to do this in five separate parts which hopefully will make up a coherent whole i am going to read all of this because it 's complicated part one the nature of experience there are two ways of looking at the world as a place of things and as a forum for action because we are living beings and must make our way pragmatically in the world the second way of looking has to take precedence this means that the world as a place of things is nested inside the world as a forum for action this means that our conceptualization of the world as objective must remain subordinate to our conceptualization of the world as a place of being this is from the first part of my book maps of meaning quote the world can be validly construed as forum for action or place of things the former manner of interpretation more primordial and less clearly understood finds its expression in the arts or humanities in ritual drama literature and mythology of the world as forum for action is a place of value a place where all things have meaning this meaning which is shaped as a consequence of social interaction is implication for action or at a higher level of analysis implications for the configuration of the interpretive schema that produces or guides action the latter manner of interpretation the world as place of things finds its formal expression in the methods and theories of science science allows for increasingly precise determination of the consensually validate able properties of things and for if utilization of precisely determined things as tools once the direction such use is to take has been determined through application of more fundamental narrative processes no complete world picture can be generated without use of both modes of construal the fact that one mode is generally set at odds with the other means only that the nature of their respective domains remains insufficiently discriminated adherents of the mythological worldview tend to regard the statements of their creed 's as indistinguishable from empirical fact even though such statements were generally formulated long before the notion of objective reality emerged those who by contrast accept the scientific perspective who assume that it is or might become complete forget that an impassable gulf currently divides what is from what should be i wrote this a little later it 's also relevant as introduction to what we are going to discuss in a bit the world can be validly construed as a forum for action as well as a place of things we describe the world as a place of things using the formal methods of science the techniques of narrative however myth literature and drama portray the world as a forum for action the two forms of representation have been unnecessarily set at odds because we have not yet formed a clear picture of their respective domains the domain of the former scientific domain is the objective world what is from the perspective of inter subjective perception the domain of the latter drama and narrative is the world of value what is and what should be from the perspective of emotion and action the world as a forum for action presents itself in two stories the normal story i was at point - a,0.2134,and you want to get a relationship with god and you have not had a relationship you finding out who god is you have been living a certain life that you do not think is that you

people get baptized and this is what it says in acts 2 and 38 is be baptized for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit the holy ghost whichever scripture you read you need to be born again do not let nobody lie to you and say confess with your mouth believe your heart and nobody told nobody that that 's that 's religion making it up the people in the bible said repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit let me give you an example jesus was baptized and he received the power of the holy spirit everybody remember his baptism baptized in water he was not sprinkled he was baptized fully immersed in water came up the spirit fell on him like a dove nicodemus had had accident what was that all about you must be born again is what he told nicodemus and this is what i am telling you i am telling you what jesus told nicodemus you must be born of the water and the spirit you must be born of the water in the spirit in order to see our enter into the kingdom of god verily verily i say to you surely surely i say to you unless a man is born again he would not inherit the kingdom of god and i am telling you this because that 's what jesus told nicodemus born again water and spirit water is baptism spirit is receiving the gift of the holy spirit i have scriptures to back up what i am saying all you got to do is matthew 28:19 be born it says go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them that that 's a that 's an indication of what the truth is and what jesus was preaching go to mark 16:16 you can place mark of this i am talking about this at 48 minutes you can go back and look it up mark 16:16 says though them that believe and it 's baptized shall be saved them that believe it not shall be damned that gives you indications clear indications that you shall be baptized you shall be baptized and people say baptism is a party of salvation go to first peter 3:21 first peter 3:21,0.4121,so that 's a problem for president trump but the bigger problem for joe biden right now is how does he unify the party because bernie is not going to step back inside the party remember bernie is not a party animal bernie does not really belong in the democratic party he who spends his entire life doing nothing and being a gadfly has been his entire life now the democratic party is picked and chosen from bernie 's agenda right they picked from the bernie tree but that does not mean that bernie is in good standing with the democratic party or anything like that so bringing him back into the fold hillary was not able to bring bernie back into the fold in 2016 after bernie appeared to be the de facto democratic nominee just three weeks ago him being rejected by an overwhelming number of big - name democratic donors as well as a lot of big - name democratic politicians and the dnc you could see the bernie bros you are saying listen we will stay home we do not care as much as joe biden is trying to reach out to the bernie bros a lot earnie bros are not going to be into this and despite the attempts by the pod save america krabs said we got a rally to be trump i am not certain i really am not certain that there are a lot of bernie sanders voters who hate trump more than they hate the democratic party establishment i think there may be a lot of times there may be a lot of burning voters who hate the democratic establishment more and want to punish the democratic establishment for nominating biden and so simply just do not go to vote by the way the same thing would have happened inside the republican party if trump had not been given the nomination at the at the convention if trump had ended up being skunked at the very last minute by a coalition there 's a good shot that a lot of those trump voters would have just said listen we are not going to show up we do not want an especially if in am in favor of jeb right if it 'd have been in favor of somebody who is long considered sort of the next in line there have been a lot of republican voters who had walked away from the republican party the same thing could be in the offing and the democrats are making a fairly large - scale mistake if they refuse to that they are sort of between a rock and a hard place if they continue to let bernie sanders on tv if they continue to let bernie sanders dubay biden,0.5787,"let me ask you a question and you can you get answers in the comments do you really like facebook because we usually want to ask people they tell me they hate facebook they do not like the newsfeed that they only really use it for messenger i mean that 's really the only reason i use facebook i do not even have the app on my phone anymore many people have been talking about the demise of facebook saying that this is truly the point at which the platform will slowly die off and the reason for this is that there is a huge backlash following news that cambridge analytical a data firm was using data it was not supposed to have access to the hash tag delete facebook started to trend worldwide many news organizations started to run articles explaining how to deactivate and even delete your facebook account facebook stock then began to fall we saw elon musk announced on twitter that he had deleted tesla and spacex from facebook so certainly there does seem to be a case to state that facebook may

facebook hashtag movement is now in full swing issued a press release late tuesday night to announce its withdrawal from facebook it has deactivated the playboy accounts that playboy enterprise manages directly affecting some 25 million fans according to the company playboy becomes the latest company to join the call to delete facebook after the cambridge analytic a scandal punctuated on friday by elon musk 's order to remove tesla and spacex pages from zuckerberg social media juggernaut the official statement from playboy enterprises inc regarding facebook for years it has been difficult for playboy to express our on facebook due to its strict content and policy guidelines we have been faced with the only alternative being to alter playboy 's voice in order to meet facebook 's views of what is and is not appropriate on its platform while that has challenged our business objectives and the ability to reach our audience in an authentic way the recent news about facebook 's alleged mismanagement of users data has solidified our decision to suspend our activity on the platform at this time there are more than 25 million fans who engage with playboy via our various facebook pages and we do not want to become complicit in exposing them to the reported practices that is why we have announced that we will be leaving facebook 's platform deactivating the playboy accounts that playboy enterprises manages directly playboy has always stood for personal freedom and the celebration of sex today we take another step in that ongoing fight elon musk already gained a ton of attention when he announced tesla and spacex would be removed from the platform from cnbc elon musk facebook gives me the willies friday musk deleted his company facebook pages for both spacex and tesla then on saturday in response to a story from enthusiast site tesla motor club reporting the news musk said deleting the pages was not an effort to make a public comment about facebook nor was it any response to a dare instead he says he deleted the pages for tesla because he does not like the social media behemoth in one tweet stating it 's not a political statement and i do not do this because someone dared me to do it just do not like facebook gives me the willies sorry and in response to venturebeat he said we never advertised with facebook none of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake endorsed product lives or dies on its own merits naturally when you have these high profile facebook deactivations or deletions a lot of people think that the trend is really really powerful and this might be spelling the demise of facebook this follows the delete facebook hashtag trend amid the cambridge analytic a scandal from cbs news a movement called delete facebook has been spreading ever since a whistleblower came forward saying he and a data firm he worked for exploited a loophole in facebook to harvest data from 50 million users even the founder of whatsapp which facebook bought in 2014 for 19 billion dollars tweeted it 's time to delete facebook now elon musk says it was not political he just said facebook gives him the willies now i have a question for you have you ever had a conversation with a friend or gone to the store and look at something and then all of a sudden you see an advertisement for that on facebook many of us have had this experience where facebook will recommend someone and we have no idea how they knew that we were some way connected to that person or an advertisement appeared and we just had no idea how they knew we were thinking about this product sure when you google search something we get that that these websites have cookies and they they track your data to a certain extent but just a few months ago i was at walmart and there was a big tv on display and my brother and i were talking about it we come back home and 10 minutes later my brother got an advertisement for that tv how does something like that happen certainly that 's enough to give people the willies the other day on reddit someone posted this to design they said fb messenger reading my text to shove ads in my face and in their message they said here 's the recipe let me know if you can open this and sure enough there 's an advertisement from food network find recipes in a post from three years ago someone was asking if facebook was reading their private messages because they said one of my friends got banned for 24 hours and received a message from facebook telling him that he was banned because he sent a private message to one of his friends and that the photos violates facebook policies down below someone said same thing has just happened to me a moment ago facebook banned me for posting images seven days because one of the images i sent privately violated facebook policy and these are just anecdotes but these are examples of people feeling like facebook is doing something nefarious that facebook is spying on them what i have talked about in the past few days is that facebook is absolutely collecting data from third parties who never agreed to give that data to facebook now facebook might ask you when you sign up or use their mobile app can they have access to your data and certainly you can allow them to have this access but let us say facebook is tracking your call logs and your text message history the people who are calling you and texting you never agreed to give their metadata to facebook they never agreed to give their phone number to facebook what happens let us say you have 10 people who all know this one person and they all receive phone calls from them facebook now knows who this person called at every point of the day because everyone else is in facebook 's network suffice it to say facebook gives me the willies too according to pj media cambridge analytical whistleblower facebook able to listen to you at home and work cambridge analytical whistleblower christopher wiley appearing before a committee of british mps on tuesday said that facebook has the ability to spy on users in their homes and offices the british parliament is investigating cambridge analytic --iz involvement in the brexit election mp damien collins who chaired the committee asked wiley whether facebook has the ability to listen to what people are talking about in order to better target them with ads there 's been various speculation about the fact that facebook can through the facebook app on your smartphone listen in to what people are talking about and discussing and using that to prioritize the advertising as well colin said other people would say no they do not think it 's possible it 's just that the facebook system is just so good at predicting what you are interested in that it can guess he asked for wiley 's thoughts on the possibility on a comment about using audio and processing audio you can use it for my understanding generally of how companies use it not just facebook but generally other apps that pull audio is for environmental context wiley said so if for example you have a television playing versus if you are in a busy place with a lot of people talking versus a work environment he clarified it 's not to say they are listening to what you are saying it 's not natural language processing that would be hard to scale but to understand the environmental context of where you are to improve the contextual value of the ad itself is possible facebook has long denied allegations that 's at listen non - users in order to customize ads i run ads product at facebook we do not and have never used your microphone for ads just not true robin goldman vice president of ads product at facebook tweeted on october 2017 that includes facebook owned instagram he added one thing you need to consider when you hear a pr statement from anybody is that people generally do not volunteer information that they do not have to take for instance the latest data scandal facebook says that you can download your data and see exactly what they have on you and in many of the instances you can actually request that they delete it what they do not tell you is that they have collected information about you from other people and you have no access to that and you can not delete it",0.2821,right he 's saying that we are not talking about that here we are talking about a case in which even rover and casey suggest that there is a countervailing interest with regard to potential human life as they put it in that case or as as better philosophers would put a human life with potential alito continues defenders of ron casey do not claim that any new scientific learning calls for a different answer to the underlying moral question they do contend that changes in society require the recognition of a constitutional right to obtain an abortion without the availability of abortion they maintain people will be inhibited from exercising their freedom to choose the types of relationship they desire women will be unable to compete with men in the workplace and in other endeavors americans who believe that abortion should be restricted press countervailing arguments about modern developments they note that attitudes about the pregnancy of unmarried women have changed drastically that federal and state laws banned discrimination on the basis of pregnancy that leave for pregnancy and childbirth are now guaranteed by law in many cases that the cost of medical care associated with pregnancy are covered by insurance or governmental assistance that states have increasingly adopted safe haven laws which generally allow women to drop off babies anonymously that a woman who puts her newborn up for adoption today has little reason to fear the baby will not find a suitable home they also claim many people now have a new appreciation of fetal life and that when prospective parents want to have a child view a sonogram they typically have no doubt that what they see as their daughter or son both sides make important policy arguments but supporters of rowan casey must show this court has the authority to weigh those arguments and decide how abortion may be regulated in the states they have failed to make that showing he thus return to the power to weigh those of those arguments to the people and their elected representatives again this is such easy basic constitutional law there are lots of policy arguments on both sides not our job to do policy arguments our job is to look at the constitution and see if there 's anything that prohibits legislatures flowing in the answer is no therefore it goes back to the states and then alito moves on to the question of sorry decisions now starry decisions the question of precedent basically when the left says that they like precedent they mean they like precedent that upholds what they want so roe versus wade is a precedent however the supreme court case line that suggested bowers versus hardwick which suggested that there is no right to sodomy that was bad president needed to be overruled so in other words the left constantly picks and chooses which precedent they think ought to apply they love roe because they love roe not because they think it 's good precedent and as alito says we have long recognized sorry decisions is not an inexorable command it is at its weakest when we interpret the constitution it has been said that it is sometimes more important that an it should be settled and that it be settled right when it comes to the interpretation of the constitution the great charter of our liberties which was meant to endure through a long lapse of ages we place a high value on having the matter settled right in addition when one of our constitutional decisions goes astray the country is usually stuck with the bad decision unless we correct our own mistake in erroneous constitutional decision can be fixed by amending the constitution but our constitution is notoriously hard to amend therefore in appropriate circumstances we must be willing to reconsider and if necessary overrule constitutional decisions and he points out that brown versus board overruled pressy versus plessy versus ferguson and he pointed out that west west coast hotel overruled lochner versus new york and he points out that there are a wide variety of constitutional decisions that overrule other bad constitutional decisions as alito says no justice of this court has ever argued the court should never overrule a constitutional decision but overruling precedence is a serious matter it is not a step that should be taken lightly our cases have attempted to provide a framework for deciding what a precedent should be overruled they have identified factors that should be considered in making such a decision in this case five factors weigh strongly in favor of overruling roe and casey the nature of the error the quality of their reasoning the workability of the rules they imposed their disruptive effect on other areas of the law and the absence of concrete reliance and then a leader goes through each of these he says the nature of the court 's error an erroneous interpretation of the constitution is always important some are more damaging than others he says roe was all all egregiously wrong and deeply damaging for reasons already explained rose constitutional analysis was far outside the bounds of any reasonable interpretation of the various constitutional provisions to which it vaguely pointed,0.6726,so why is he doing that obviously the speculation is that it 's a scop essentially that he 's reversing himself that really he wants trump this is what the media want to say that he really really wants trump and that he is saying biden specifically so that people will vote against biden thinking that he is working with biden whatever the case may be the bottom line is that the biden administration has slow walked a ukraine at the beginning made absolutely unclear what america 's interests are in ukraine in the first place which has undermined a lot of american support for ukraine in the first place meanwhile the president unleashed some new sanctions yesterday they are on more than 500 targets apparently they are set to be rolled out by the treasury and state departments in full today they come after the white house signal that they were preparing major penalties after the recent death of nalni in a russian prison this according to the new york times the us has been closely coordinating with europe and its efforts to cut russia off from the global economy this week the eu unveiled its 13th tranch of sanctions on russia banning nearly 200 people and entities that have been helping russia procure weapons from traveling or doing business within the block now listen if if biden wanted to do more than this he certainly could he could be pushing secondary sanctions on major companies that are doing business with the russians he could be trying to put pressure on the chinese and the iranians unfortunately he 's doing none of those things so again lack of clarity on policy from the president of the united states and this of course is leading people to think that there is no plan because there kind of is not according to joe biden according to the same new york times that has been stumping consistently for support for the war in ukraine quote the biden administration and european allies called president putin of russia a tyrant and a war criminal but he enjoys a standing invitation to the halls of power in brazil the president of brazil says ukraine and russia are both to blame for the war that began with russia 's military invasion his nation 's purchases of russian energy and fertilizer have soared pumping billions of dollars into the russian economy and as we noted yesterday the secretary of state went to hang out with lula and praise him literally yesterday two years after after the beginning of the war according to the new york times putin is not nearly as isolated as us officials had hoped russia 's inherent strength rooted in its vast supplies of oil and natural gas has powered a financial and political resilience that threatens to outlast western opposition in parts of asia africa and south america his influence is as strong as ever or even growing his grip on power at home appears as strong as effort as well the war has undoubtedly taken a toll on russia it has wrecked the country standing with much of europe beyond north america and europe however there is a lot of evidence to the contrary with china india and brazil buying russian oil in record quantities now again this would be an opportunity for the united states to use the power of its lng industry in order to undercut the russians but are they doing that nope because the environmentalists because the big threat is climate meanwhile are they putting pressure on places like brazil no they were too busy celebrating when yer bolsero lost the election to lula d silva that corrupt oligarch meanwhile apparently the pentagon is learning new lessons from the war in ukraine and the thing they are mostly learning is that we spend a lot of money on tech and not enough money on you know actual weaponry according to the washington post the character of war is changing the lessons taken from ukraine stand to be an enduring resource the ukraine conflict has challenged core assumptions the war has become an attritional slugfest with each side attempting to wear down the other a model thought to be anachronistic said stacy pettan director of the defense program at center for a new american security it is complicated a long held believe in the pentagon that expensive precision weapons are central to winning america 's conflict gps guided munitions provided to ukraine have proven vulnerable to electronic jamming its military has adapted by pairing older unguided artillery with sensors and drones which can be used to spot targets and refine their shots so they have also told people to stop using cell phones near the front lines personnel portraying enemy forces during one simulated attack were unable to determine the path the helicopter took but after examining commercially available cell phone data they were able to map the journey of a device traveling across the desert at 120 miles per hour and it reveals where in apache fleu to evade the defenses so again the american military is uh is learning some things from this battle suffice it to say however that russia so far has survived if you want to know more about the history of ukraine that vladimir putin sit as his rationale for attacking ukraine we did we are putting out an episode of facts that goes through the entire history of ukraine what 's true what 's not and all the rest when it comes to the actual situation in ukraine however again it 's joe biden 's leadership that has that has been a failure here across the board it 's been a real problem,0.6071,what happens if joe biden withdraws from the democratic nomination what happens if he steps down from office what happens if joe biden dies in office dealing with everything we have to do with uh look each of these scenarios is quite possible and each carries significant constitutional legal and social implications so let us dissect these possibilities one by one let us first consider the scenario where joe biden steps down from the democratic nomination but remains president this would be politically the worst case scenario for the democrats who would leave the next nominee carrying joe biden 's baggage without ever assuming the power of the presidency but how exactly would that happen well first let us make one thing clear there is no real mechanism for forcing joe biden off the ticket if he does not want to go the so - called faithful delegate rule was put in place by the democratic national committee in 1980 to prevent delegates pledged to then president jimmy carter from defecting to senator ted kennedy current democratic national committee language says quote delegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiment of those who elected them now theoretically that could be interpreted to allow delegates to abandon biden but that is super unlikely if however joe biden does withdraw his candidacy before the dnc the delegates pledged him would be free to support another candidate now he could recommend his delegates follow another of the candidates like kl harris but they are not bound to his wishes they do not have to do what he wants them to do the dnc 's rules allow for a conscience clause where delegates can vote their conscience if a nominee steps down if the delegates are freed intense lobbying and campaigning will follow the the democratic national committee has established rules for such scenarios if biden steps down as presumptive nominee after securing the nomination but before the election say you know like this week the dnc would convene to select a new nominee that process would involve consultation with democratic governors congressional leaders party officials to ensure a smooth transition this decision could lead to significant internal conflicts within the democratic party going all the way to the convention in chicago ironically debates would arise whether the vice president harris should be the nominee or if other candidates should be considered the party would also need to manage the optics of joe biden stepping down his nominee which would most likely lead to disarray and could weaken voter confidence in the democrats generally historic incidences such as when hubert humphrey became the democratic nominee in 1968 after lynnden baines johnson decided not to run show how critical the party 's handling of such transition can be the new nominee would face the challenge of quickly building a campaign of fundraising and establishing a platform which could put them at a disadvantage considering that there 's not a lot of time left before the election tom harris does have an advantage here since she would presumably use the same campaign infrastructure as the biden harris campaign and legally she can do that ensuring a smooth and transparent transition would be crucial to maintaining voter confidence for the democrats as well the political dynamics within the party would be really really complex this truncated campaign period between now and the convention would require rapid mobilization and strategic planning to unify the party and appeal to the broader electorate and how many 's ability to quickly establish something that resembles at least a clear and compelling vision would be important this would involve not only addressing current issues but also articulating a forward - looking agenda that voters actually care about good luck with that democrats the current democratic possibilities have relatively low name recognition other than kamla harris and uh you know people do not like kamla harris in fact kamla harris is bad poll numbers that 's one of the main reasons democrats have been so hesitant to try to force biden out next we will explore what happens if joe biden steps down not only from the nomination but also from the presidency this is a less likely scenario because biden seems unlikely to give up the power but it should be discussed nonetheless especially because it 's really difficult to make the case biden is not well enough to be the nominee but he 's still well enough to be the most powerful person on the planet dude sund downing at like 400 p.m. according to the presidential succession act in the 25th amendment if biden resigns the office of the presidency then vice president harris immediately assumes the presidency the process is clear - cut it has historical presidence when rich nixon resigned in 1974 amidst watergate for example vice president gerald ford became president of the office on which i am about to enter so help me god so help me god ford then nominated nelson rockefeller as his vice president and rockefeller was confirmed by congress the transition is straightforward from a constitutional perspective as well the 25th amendment ensures a smooth transfer of power preventing any potential vacuum in leadership newly assumed president harris would nominate a vp who would have to be confirmed by a majority vote in both the house and the senate that process is designed to ensure continuity and stability in the executive branch furthermore the 25th amendment provides a mechanism for dealing with presidential disabilities if biden were to step down due to health reasons this amendment ensures harris can assume the duties of the presidency seamlessly this aspect of the amendment was added after the assassination of jfk to address potential gaps in leadership continuity you might think you are getting everything your body needs from that green juice that you have been chugging down every morning you however are likely not most people still fall

said about them so the minute that roger could leave this country he did and in 2006 he moved to japan and as soon as he could he gave up his us citizenship and got citizenship in st kits and nevas because he needed somewhere else to belong and did not feel safe being an amer any longer which as an american is horrible to me right we should be proud of our country we should we should keep our best and our brightest we should not be chasing them out and so at that time he had to uh when you renounce your us citizenship there 's something called the exit tax which is this unconstitutional tax um that you have to pay upon leaving if you are worth over $ 2 million and uh roger did his utmost to fully comply with that there 's a motion to dismiss that you can find on freer roger now.org which lays it all out and shows without beyond a shadow of a doubt that he did everything he possibly could to comply and yet the us government has been going scorched earth against him since that time attempting to take him down and why are they doing that well roger 's been one of the biggest critics of the us government 's uh you know many of their programs he has been funding the anti - war movement he 's been funding the anti - lockdown movement he 's been funding the med medical freedom movement he 's been funding the anti - censorship movement and he 's been been one of the biggest voices behind crypto uh behind centralized finance behind permissionless peer - to - peer exchange of value and that is a threat to the deep state and that 's why they are after roger you know this is a pattern we saw a similar type of lawfare against ross alri who definitely did some things wrong but does not believe you know deserve two life sentences for that for similar type of cryptocurrency um related pioneering um tracy can you explain that a little bit more that people that get into cryptography that get into some of these alternative ways of um disrupting our the antiquated currency model and in new technology seem to be recipients very forcefully um from the federal government and the traditional banking system there is no greater threat to the traditional banking system than permissionless peer - to - peer decentralized exchange between individuals there 's simply no greater threat and so if you are a person who supports that if you are a person who pioneers that if you are one of the people that who enables that you have a target on your back there 's absolutely no question and few people did that more than roger did he was the earliest investor in cryptocurrency in the cryptocurrency space the earliest investor in bitcoin promoted it at a level that nobody else did you know he early on he 'd go into a coffee shop and um and you know you know get get coffee and then offer to pay in bitcoin or he would just walk up to people on the street and say hey let me help you set up a bitcoin wallet let me tell you how bitcoin works help with this and of course the people who accepted that from him have done very well for themselves if you started taking you know if you got $ 10 worth of bitcoin from roger when it was two to three dollars a bitcoin you have done very well and this is why they hate him because if you if you are a a central banker nothing terrifies you more than people being outside your control outside the control of the fed outside of the control of the coming cbdc system and in a world where people are being debanked where people are being deprogrammed where people are being censored the most powerful thing we have is permissionless finance it 's bitcoin,0.6502,and you get the left is tears tumblr you are going to need it now more than ever go to daily wire.com we will be right back so president trump has called out the fake news media again and again and again he pointed out that we go too easy on these guys you know they jump on us anything we do i mentioned media matters a lot because they just exist to pounce on whatever conservatives ever say and get us to lose our jobs and conservatives do not do that back to them we do not even have an organization that does that so last week news came out that don lemon is being accused of sexual assault at a bar that just happens to be one of my favorite bars in new york it 's in long island in sag harbor and i said look conservatives should give it to democrats as good as we get it from democrats conservatives should give it to the left as good as we get it and when the left starts offering us grace three times in a row then we can offer grace to the left but on the point itself you just do not know if these allegations are true now we are getting more information it looks like this allegation against don lemon might be true he 's alleged to have been at this bar at murph 's one of my favorite bars good hard drinking spots so people who are definitely having a couple coca - cola 's over there and some guy goes up to him and says hey you are don lemon can i buy you a drink he 's like now i am actually hanging out with my friends then later on in the night when everybody is plastered don lemon walks up to him and allegedly asks the guy if he 's sexually attracted to him reaches into his own pants touches himself and then puts it in the guy 's face and now the guy is suing don lemon george goon ellis who was the boss of the plaintiff at the time came forward and corroborated the account so he said yep dustin that 's the plaintiff works for me as a bartender and we went out after work one night we were standing there he said hey it 's don lemon murph 's is a place you go to drink after you have been out drinking as i told you he 's corroborating my story as well we just gotten off work that 's why we ended up there because we worked in the restaurant business by the time everything is done we can only hit up a late night spot don lemon comes around the corner stands face to face with us he 's saying so you like me is that why you are bothering me the other guy says not i just wanted to say what 's up then according to this guy goon ellis that don lemon said do you like me is that why you are bothering me because you want to f me put his hands down his pants inside his board shorts grabbed his genitals then came out with two fingers and clipped dustin 's nose up and down with the two fingers and said do you like female genitals or male genitals i will clean up the language that was apparently used so he 's corroborating it you got a guy going on the record talking about that looks like don lemon might be in a little bit of trouble lemon apparently allegedly offered to settle for a couple hundred thousand dollars some amount under a million dollars the guy said now you are going to give me more money than that and so now this is going going into a lawsuit i do not even say this to go after don lemon i do not care about don lemon i do not watch his show i do not care if he has a show that is only sustained because in airports the televisions are on cnn i do not care if he 's got the three viewers who actually watch him does not matter under me unlike the left i do not care if they have their own shows but imagine if any conservative commentator journalist politician if this had happened to any of us you had an allegation like this corroborated by another eyewitness imagine there would be calls to take off our heads there were be calls to tar and feather us we would immediately lose our show immediately lose our advertisers we would be kicked out of polite company there would be sexual assault investigations you would you would be told that the republican party as a rape problem that the conservatives ever word that all the outlets have a rape problem that 's what you hear if any of that would come against conservatives and yet the story about don lemon has he been kicked off his show have his advertisers dropped no of course it 's a total double standard and this is i think what president trump was talking about when he was actually chastising sean hannity for defending chris cuomo a cnn host in his own little pr scandal which is they do not defend us they go for the jugular against us they try to kill us and we fight back because we believe in a civil society we believe in having a little bit of grace extending that to us having a little gratitude having a little humility they do not have it,0.171,"so the world is beginning to unlock the lock downs are starting to end not just in the united states but everywhere and one of the things that 's always been very weird about how the media have treated the situation in the united states is that they are treating the situation in the united states as though the united states exists in a vacuum it does not other places in the world saw deaths arising about the same time as the united states and many of them are starting to relieve lockdown lockdowns at the same time as the united states countries that were much harder hit than the united states here 's the reality of the situation by the way the united states was really hard hit in one place new york at every other place in the united states we had some places that were sort of moderate but in terms of broad span united states if you took new york out of the calculations meaning its population as well as the number of deaths from coronavirus the united states has the same about number of deaths per hundred thousand residents from coronavirus as germany does and germany is leading the pack right now in terms of western european countries and how they are doing with this thing so really is new york centric new york is a is an oddity because new york is so crowded because the the rates of transmission are higher in new york simply because people are right on top of each other taking the subway that does not really exist anywhere else in the united states in the same way that it does in new york which is why new york city has seen 12,000 or so deaths and those are just ones that have been counted the truth is is probably a little bit higher other places in the world they have been harder hit places like spain places like italy these are places that are starting to relieve their lockdowns right now according to the ap spain let children go outside and place on there for the first time in six weeks as european countries methodically worked to ease their lock downs and reopen their economies while governors in the united states moved to different speeds some more aggressive others more cautious around the world china 's state - run media said that hospitals in wuhan the original epicenter of the disaster no longer have any cove in 19 patients after a crisis in which the city recorded nearly 4,000 deaths now do we believe china on that probably not they have actually locked down movie theaters again in beijing so that suggests that this thing is not in fact dead so anything that comes out of beijing can not be trusted but prime minister boris johnson in britain is planning to be back at his desk monday at 10 downing street after he had coronavirus governors in states like new york and michigan are keeping stay at home restrictions in place until at least in may but even those governors are starting to figure out exactly how they transition back to regular life especially for people who are not in major urban areas major cities with heavy population densities their counterparts in places like georgia oklahoma alaska are starting to allow certain businesses to reopen churches in montana began holding in - person services again on sunday and that does make some sense because again a lot of these states have not been heavily damaged a lot of these states never went into lockdown in the first place and we are still not heavily damaged and it is important to recognize that it was failures in specifically high population places that led to certain things getting out of control new york city did not lock down until very late bill de blasio did not lock down new york city until nearly the end of march like a full week after the entire state of california locked down andrew cuomo still had a rule in place for weeks that if you were infected with coronavirus and you were elderly they had to accept you back at your nursing home which is like the worst idea ever they did the same thing in california by the way in italy one of the big reasons that things went a raged out of control in italy is specifically because it was high population density and also because of the demographics and healthcare deficiencies according to the associated press biologists and epidemiologists say what went wrong in lombardi will be studied for years given how the outbreak overwhelmed the medical system long considered to be one of europe 's best well in the neighboring veneto region the impact was significantly more controlled lombardi 's frontline doctors and nurses are being hailed as heroes for risking their lives to treat the sick under extraordinary levels of stress exhaustion isolation and fear what exactly happened while italy was the first european country talked to all air traffic with china on january 31st even put scanners and airports to check arrivals for fever by january 31st it was already too late epidemiologists now say the virus had been circulating widely in lombardi since early january if not before and that is at least partly the fault of china which was still lying to the world health organization and saying there was no human to human transmission doctors treating pneumonia in january and february do not know it was the corona virus because the symptoms were so similar and the virus was still believed to be largely confined to china even after italy registered a february 21st case which was its first death doctors do not understand the unusual wake of it 19 could present itself with patients experiencing a rapid decline in their ability to breathe one of the weird things about kovin 19 is that people will arrive in the hospital and seem to be breathing fine but their oxygen saturation levels are like",0.4758,i am afraid i have some terrible news the governor of america 's largest and richest state has just signed a law that puts 10 million children and adolescents in grave danger of medical mistreatment the media headlines are all wrong they claim that california governor gavin newsome 's new law protects children by stopping public schools from outing their gender to their parents in fact it does just the opposite of that this new law makes children vulnerable to irreversible and lifelong medical abuse and mistreatment and it 's all based on a pseudo scientific idea that some children are born into the wrong bodies and that we can change a person 's sex through drugs and surgery now for any of this to make sense you have to understand what 's happening right now in britain several years ago the government there appointed a well resected pediatrician named hillary cass to investigate whether it was ethical to block the puberty of children give them opposite sex hormones and perform surgeries on their bodies in an effort to make them feel better about their gender dr cass came back a few weeks ago and said no absolutely not around the same time the british government banned puberty blockers nationwide and just a few days ago the new labor party government affirmed that it would maintain the former conservative governments ban on puberty blockers in her report cass said that so - called social transition where a children adopts the identity of the opposite sex is not a neutral act and has psychological consequences in fact it 's the first step towards medical intervention what gavin newsome has done is actively prevented schools from informing parents that their children have been put on a medical pathway this is an outrageous attack on both the rights of the children and the parents children have a right to go through puberty no adult should be able to block their puberty and parents have a right to know if their children thinks that they are the opposite sex or were born into the wrong body we have seen with leaked internal documents from the leading gender medicine group w paath that these medical interventions namely puberty blockers hormones and surgeries are not only irreversible but result in sterilization and loss of sexual function children and adolescents are simply not mature enough to understand the effects of so - called gender affirming care they can not in other words give their informed consent the new law that gavin nome just signed creates the grave risk that activist teachers students and outside groups will convince children that they were born into the wrong body and then hide their social transition from parents which will lead to these harmful medical mistreatments as such the law that was passed is the opposite of what both children and their parents need we need schools to immediately warn parents if their children think they are the opposite sex after all this is a diagnosable psychiatric condition known as as gender dysphoria and if your child has a psychiatric disorder whether it 's anxiety depression an eating disorder or gender dysphoria you as a parent have a right to know and schools must stop teaching children or allowing other people to teach children this pseudo scientific and dehumanizing ideas that it 's possible to be born in the wrong body and it 's possible to change one 's sex it 's not as such either the legislature the courts or a ballot initiative in california is required to nullify this law until then it 's important to spread the word to parents that california public schools are fundamentally unsafe for the millions of children who currently attend them so this is obviously insane and it,0.5277,"but i think it 's going to be a long while before we get there because i still think that the vast majority of americans do not believe like the radical left believes that said this is one of the reasons why it 's important how we talk about politics this is why the mannerisms of militants actually do not help us generate victory they do not help generate political victory what helps us generate political victory is making better arguments than the other side calling them out when they make bad character attacks calling them out for lack of character when they do those sorts of things but the constant the constant idea that we have to hit be weapons up all the time eventually somebody 's going to pull the trigger and things will get ugly at that point the more weapons that go up the better chance that somebody is going to pull the trigger and that is a serious problem now speaking of pulling the trigger there is a crazy thing that is happening right now where a bunch of folks on the left are now attempting to ban 3d gun printing we talked a little bit yesterday about the fact that folks in the media do not know what in the hell they are talking about when they talk about printing of 3d guns they really think that i am going to take my hp laserjet and print out a gun in my house right now like they they really think that 's the thing i can do that i can just go into my library and i can print out a gun from my from my normal printer because they hear printing and this is what they think that 's not how it works an actual 3d printing machine costs upwards of eight thousand dollars all the way up to a hundred thousand dollars nobody is sitting in their basement actually printing out fully plastic guns and that is illegal you are not allowed to manufacture guns that are not detectable and that is just not something that happens people have been manufacturing their own guns literally for centuries people making guns in their house with gun making kits most of those who made of metal most of the parts are coming from actual gun manufacturers but the left is driving this narrative that the new great danger in the united states is going to be 3d guns that 's going to be the great danger that 's where all of the danger in the united states is coming from so senator markey who does not know legitimately a damn thing about guns he was speaking yesterday he says 3d guns are a national security risk in a world where a 3d printer cartridge has become as deadly as a gun cartridge and that 's because these downloadable firearms are available even to those who could not pass a background check it 's the ultimate gun loophole what in the world is he talking about ed markey does not know what he is talking about the idea they are a bunch of felons who are sending their basements with $ 100,000 printing machines for 3d plastic guns is just ridiculous if a felon lawns to get a gun the easiest way to do it is just to buy it illegally really",0.5416
so so if you if you have a lobster you know that 's a friend of yours and it 's feeling depressed then you could recommend recomend that it uses serotonin reuptake inhibitors and that will make it you know a happy stretched out sort of confident lobster instead of a you know bunched up and insecure lobster and the reason i am telling you that it is pretty comical and um but the reason i am telling you that is because it indicates something of tremendous importance which is that you are one old thing and there are elements of your structure that are you know that are importantly hundreds of millions of years old and they structure the way that the world appears to you and so an archetypical idea in some sense is a is an idea that you can understand because you are a human being and you know if you think about this even for a few moments you can understand how this might be you know if someone comes up to you and says i am angry today especially if you have been conversing them with them for some time it is not generally necessary for you to ask well what do you mean angry you might ask well why are you angry or what happened but because the person who 's making the statement has a nervous system like your nervous system you can both mutually assume that you know you have understood and experienced the emotion of anger and so instead of trying to describe what that 's like you can just describe the particular situations that elicited it and you know there 's lots of evidence for basic emotions i mean the list of basic emotions varies from thinker to thinker although they congregate around a pretty definable set and part of the reason that they differ at all is because well it is not obvious how you distinguish an emotion from a motivational system and it 's not even obvious that that you know the class of emotion is a reasonable class but there are certainly um subjective phenomena that emerge as a consequence of the active activity of fundamental brain systems that everyone shares so you know people understand what fear means means people understand what pain means uh disappointment frustration people understand what surprise means they understand joy um they understand disgust i think i hit most of the major ones there and then there 's you know there 's other systems that do not look so emotion likee that are maybe more motivation like like hunger and thirst and and you know uncomfortable heat and uncomfortable coldness that people also understand and the reason you understand that is because you are a certain way and you are a certain way because for the same reason you have two legs most of you and two arms and two eyes and all of that you know you are you do not just spring out of the void as a completely unstructured organism and you know it 's difficult to say exactly what elements of human experience and behavior and cognition and thought and all that are inbuilt precisely because we are also quite modifiable from a cultural perspective you know,0.1023,you know trump is doing well in one poll trump was beating biden in ohio that 's hilarious because that was bill maher 's reason for defending joe biden he 's the only one who beats trump in ohio unfortunately not according to some of the latest polls but when it comes to national polling i find it to be mostly irrelevant now take a look at this trump approval at gallup highest better than obama and bush you want to tell me trump is concerned about his about whether he 's going to win or lose look i know trump is trying to win that 's why he 's he 's going full into these message the messaging about biden but let us be real donald trump is going after biden obama because he wants vindication because he 's personally slighted anybody who denies that donald trump has got a major ego problem is lying to themselves and everybody else donald trump is very narcissistic very arrogant very egotistical and a lot of people really really love him for it i think donald trump has got some character issues but donald trump certainly believes he 's going to win he rags on sleepy joe biden all day he 's got the national polls showing approval ratings and there 's something interesting here donald trump 's stealth voters the amount of people who approve of donald trump in the aggregate differ from the amount of people who say they 'd vote for him that does not make sense and i was reading a story the other day that said that that do not exist before we have not seen that in obama or bush this shows us there are a lot of people that think trump is doing a good job but will not publicly admit they would vote for the guy when you when you can see that donald trump has got a higher approval rating than obama i do not think trump is going after biden or obama and the obama administration with obamigate because he 's scared of losing i think it was an attack on his character on his person and he takes that seriously he takes them more seriously than many other things look you want to criticize donald trump you can if there 's one thing i think we can all agree on the man certainly loves himself he puts his name in big gold letters on top on on buildings so whether you think this is a defensive m i do not care the point is i do not think donald trump trump is really concerned about him losing to joe biden i think what he really cares about is how history will remember his name this is the aggregate polling from the from real clear politics we can see gallup has has trump plus one which is amazing his uh his highest polling was actually a few weeks ago it dropped down and spiked back up right now to 46.4,0.3554,i watched what he did to conservatives and thought why do not we do that to his side it worked rather well and we found over 100 far left - wing journalists with fireball tweets 20 18 this project goes live and what will be the result of this kind of action well as the left progressively punishes the speech of others and criticized them for making jokes they say are offensive and now people who are associated with the right start doing the same thing we are going to come to a point where free speech is essentially gone sometimes in order to escape the trap you have to do the opposite of what you 'd expect it 's like a chinese finger trap the more you pull out the worse you make it and if certain is going to use the tactics of the left against them then both sides are going to continue to escalate this until people can not say anything i did a video yesterday which you may have seen where i talked about how white men are now a protected class on facebook and this resulted in women getting banned for saying men are scum many of the people so so with the left attack white people in attack men and now their speech has been silenced as well and this is the problem if this is the tactic that 's going to be used by people and both sides agree to just make it worse that 's just escalation and and things are not going to get better it 's almost like there 's no point trying to get involved in issues like this yesterday i posted a tweet where i said sam cedar will not be renewed by msnbc final campaign to highlight it past tweet in part by certain sam tried using the same tactics to smear mike however there is no one to fire him and his fans do not care and that 's just true the people who follow mike 's turn a do not care about his past transgressions in fact i am sure some of them actually liked the things he said in the past sam cedar works for msnbc and they do not like what he posted in the past so he 's not going to have his contract renewed it 's that simple it was a matter whose side you are on but sure enough the partisans came out in force accusing me of defending certain somehow in this tweet somehow by saying that sort of it just fans do not care about his past posts which are considered highly offensive is somehow defending him and sure enough they claimed that in no way was sam trying to smear mike serna except for sam 's own statement the idea is direct funding insulates my show from his attacks and i can continue to discredit him without fear of reprisal now normally i do not like to comment on stupid twitter drama or bickering between personalities but this i feel like it 's a it 's more important this is the only something i would reserve for my second channel and i was thinking about it for a while but then i started to think you know what if the left if journalists are going to attack people based on things they posted a long time ago and now people are scared to make jokes they are scared to tweet if people are told that certain things are hate speech and can get you banned from a platform if we are going to see women banned from facebook for saying men are scum and things are heading in a bad direction and then if the right the people who are normally supposed to be defending free speech or at least tor typically this past year were the ones screaming for free speech are going to adopt similar tactics then we are truly headed down a dark path i think you should be allowed to make a joke i said this yesterday before all this sam cedar serna much stuff happened you should be able to say almost whatever you want i mean short of creating clear and imminent threats death threats and things i mean like you can make jokes jokes should be okay you should be allowed to be a dick it 's not illegal to be to be a jerk and if we are going to move in this direction we are hand up in a future where everyone 's just smiling all the time and scared to say anything wrong either that we end up in a future where people just work for themselves and people like certain can do this because there 's no one to fire from so i guess we will see what happens as time goes on but let me know what you think in the comments below how do you feel about this campaign should mike serna vich have done this should msnbc have fired sam cedar,0.1587,but if you are claiming that people are rioting and looting because they are angry about slavery then you are going to have to explain why other groups that have been oppressed in the united states and abroad do not routinely go and riot and loot and the answer is because this has nothing to with slavery in fact it does not even have anything to do with police brutality this has to do with a bunch of people who are taking advantage of a of a really hot situation in order to go get a tv and that 's disgusting and it 's evil the name of anybody who suggests that is justified because america is deeply racist and endemically racist see this is the biggest problem that i have with the media and our politicians and our political class is that at the same time they are saying the president trump he 's so inflammatory so terrible they have spent decades indoctrinating people into the belief that america is deeply endemically unchangeably racist and that it 's people are racists as well and so if you grow up believing that if you grew up believing that america was racist and that all of its institutions are racist then you 'd be striking a blow for liberty by going and robbing the footlok or perhaps or at least you could theoretically make that case and you see this from people like spike lee you seen this from don lemon you seen this from charles blow the idea is that rioters looters are somehow justified because after all they are fighting the quote - unquote system and the system is racist in general it 's a vile argument it 's historically untrue i mean the fact is that the united states has changed if people have noticed just a little bit since 1964 and a change in an awful lot since 1865 and the this this notion that rioting and looting are justified by by anger against police officers again i am wondering who exactly is defending police brutality at this point i am really not seeing a lot of defenses of police brutality and beyond that i i still have yet to see the non feelings based anecdotal based evidence that police officers all over the country are unduly are unduly targeting black people this idea that racist police officers are dominant across the american landscape is not supported by the evidence it is not i mean the fact is that when people cite instances they like to say things like stop and frisk the fact is i 'd stop and frisk targeted blacks and hispanics at about rate of eighty - five percent of all stops and frisks in new york city where black and hispanic and over 90 % of all street crime in new york city as reported by victims of street crime was black and hispanic does that mean that the police officers are racist does that mean that there is something wrong with the police officers or are the police officers responding to crime in this generalized notion that police officers are willy - nilly going out and shooting unarmed black men it 's not true statistically speaking it is not true in fact if you are a a white person who is in a confrontation with police and some sort of armed confrontation with police you are more likely to be shot by the police and if you are black according to statistics put together by roland fryer the the situations in which armed people are being shot very often those situations are under conflict because somebody is attacking and got an officer with a gun is that person unarmed or is that person not unarmed like michael brown was shot while he was unarmed does after he tried to take a gun off a police officer and fired a couple of shots into his car and then attempted to charge him that 's not being shot while unarmed that that 's not shot unjustifiably,0.5296,oh no so for the lady who has to campaign on not having anything to do with joe biden it turns out that actually her entire platform is copied directly from joe biden so much so that her team was too lazy to even rewrite the source code they just cut from one and they put it in the other which is amazing even the new republic again the new republic wants her to win they wanted to win and here 's what they write today this is dangerous territory for harris given that the times poll found that more than 60 % of voters wanted the next president to represent a major change from biden and only a quarter felt that harris represented that change that makes sense given the chief is vice president but it means she should be working over time to distinguish herself from her boss this is alex shepard writing over at the new republic and this has become the sort of talking point for people who want kla harris to win is that she needs to cut joe biden loose that 's a direct quote from jonathan chay jonathan chate writes for new york magazine he has an entire piece titled kla harris should cut joe biden loose quote kla harris is navigating a tricky dilemma according to the new york times she will try to promote herself as a change candidate without criticizing president biden i have no reason to doubt this accurately conveys the calculus within the harris campaign my question is why is this a struggle why not directly repudiate unpopular biden positions joe biden is literally one person he lives in a safe safe state harris does not have to worry about forfeiting his vote even the univers of people who are personally loyal to biden and might take offense at slights to his accomplishments consists entirely of partisan democrats who will vote for the democrat at the end of the day rather than trying to balance loyalty to biden against catering to the desires of the electorate harris 's strategy should focus entirely on catering to the to the public with no attention whatsoever to biden 's feelings this ignores a simple fact which is that the democratic party represents these positions it is not just joe biden joe biden was as a politician i use the past tense because he 's no longer with us joe biden was a politician who always and forever took his flag and planted it in the middle of the democratic parade so wherever the parade moved he was always dead center of the parade that was always his shtick joe biden was never a leader in terms of thought in the democratic party he was never the edgy guy like bernie sanders he was never a visionary like barack obama he was not he was not any of those people joe biden was always a typical corrupt democratic politician who simply went wherever the prevailing winds in the democratic party blew so in the 1990s he was very anti - me so much so that he co - sponsored the 1994 crime bill and by the time we hit 2020 he was suddenly black lives matter how does that happen it was not an evolution it 's that he moves his flag all over the field and plants it wherever the democratic party is so tempting to repudiate joe biden 's positions on these issues is in fact repudiating the democratic party position it 's the only thing joe biden was ever good at was putting his finger in the air directing figuring out which way the wind was blowing and then moving in that direction joe biden is a weather vein of a politician and so if you repudiate the weather vein what do you end up with does jonathan chap want her to run as a moderate or does he want her to run as a bernie sanders radical what exactly does he want her to do and the problem is if she runs as a moderate she is running directly against her own record because kla harris is very much like joe biden as a politician she has sort of more radical instincts than joe biden joe biden 's older he 's from a different generation she has very much aoc san francisco leftist instinct politically speaking as we will talk about in a moment,0.5716,so that 's what one path looks like the other path looks like america standing tall and here 's america 's role it 's a simple role it does not require american use of force it does not require american soldiers first america must provide israel the material and moral support to destroy hamas israel will shed extraordinary of blood of its own citizens in order to protect civilians in gaza and to kill terrorists but israel will require rearmament and america should provide it and israel wounded by hamas is an invitation to broader regional and possibly global conflict second america must use our diplomatic might to push to alleviate the situation on the arab side we ought to be pushing egypt to open its border to refugees to minimize civilian casualties we should be pushing turkey to accept refugees after all they accepted 3.5 million of them from syria america ought to leverage qatar into turning over kamas leadership to an international body or to america itself and push katar to get hamas to release american and other hostages held by hamas third america must deter other actors from escalating this conflict presumably that 's why joe biden himself is visiting israel and why america currently has aircraft carriers stationed in the mediterranean an ounce of prevention will be worth kilotons of cure all of this is doable without expending significant amounts of american treasure or any american blood but that can only happen if the biden administration does not go wobbly if it does not start paring the dangerous moral equivalents of the media or the absurd perversities of international pseudo humanitarian organizations that make no demands of the terrorist group hamas which is currently holding 200 hostages including babies but makes many demands on israel america can flex her muscles without using american force in fact we should a world without america is a dark and chaotic place a more dangerous place for america and americans all that can be avoided at virtually zero cost so long as america does not actually go wobbly now the situation on the ground continues to be ugly according to the wall street journal russia and china are softly intervening on the side of kamas that is not a shock these are two of the most nefarious actors in the world right now according to the wall street journal the war between israel and hamas is not just risking a regional configration it is also affecting the global balance of power stretching american and european resources while relieving pressure on russia and providing new opportunities to china according to former finnish prime minister alexander stub what we are seeing is part of a shifting and moving world order when the us leaves power vacuums someone is going to vill those vacuums russia is the clearest beneficiary of the spreading upheaval pointing at the mounting palestinian deaths moscow rebels in what it calls the quote unquote hypocrisy of the western governments which have roundly condemned russian massacres of civilians in ukraine but offer only mild criticism of israeli actions in gaza now of course that is not even remotely acc comparable russia invaded ukraine in order to destroy the country israel is invading gaza in order to stop hamas which just killed 1300 of its citizens in fact israel had given the gaza strip to the palestinians in 2005 and hamas took over they have been in charge ever since 2005 but the russians and the chinese are attempting to create an anti - american alliance in the middle east if america were to go wobbly there things would get significantly worse for america 's interest in the middle east and forget all of the talk the happy talk about technology making oil no longer a relevant factor in the world economy that obviously is untrue and is going to remain untrue meanwhile kamas continues to ratchet up the noise so kamas has a couple of goals here goal number one is to survive the best way for them to survive is to release all the hostages today if they release all the hostages they are currently holding there will be significant pressure on israel to stop its offensive and everyone will just pretend that the 1300 dead jews around the gaza border do not exist that is likely the the calculus that is being put in place by pretty much everybody is that if kamas releases the hostages then they will call for everybody to go back to status quo anti that 's not acceptable for israel if hamas 's leadership survives intact in the gaza strip if they are continuing to lead the gaza strip after killing 13 00 jews with virtually no consequences for them all the consequences being felt by the civilians they keep in a in a cage effectively and on top of their own rockets that will be a big victory for hamas everyone knows it israel 's goals are twofold get back to hostages destroy kamas hamas 's goals are twofold humiliate israel retain power and they are really one goal,0.9891,well yes of course you like it when men pay for dinner because it demonstrates willingness to provide which is an essentially masculine characteristic when you rob men of their duty in life it turns out that men do not just disappear they become toxic when you rob men of mission they redirect those aggressive energies into all the wrong places there 's a great book by george gilder sort of a philosopher economist called men in marriage all about this and his suggestion is that basically men are robber thieves who act aggressively until they are civilized by women and all those aggressive energies are channeled in the direction of building so either men are going to destroy or men are going to build when you shut men out of the building apparatus particularly in terms of building a family when you do not channel men 's aggressive instincts toward protection of wife and hearth and home you end up with aggressively very bad men you end up with no men you end up with really bad men half population still going to end up being men the only question is whether those men are going to be channeling their energies in a positive and good direction or whether they are going to be following wwe light figures who are boasting about their muscles shirtless while driving lamborghinis around and running sex rings right that that those are the choices that you have and there are no other choic either men are going to channel their aggressive testosterone driven instinct into something good productive and wonderful society they are going to build up or they are going to tear down they are going to build cathedrals or they are going to tear cathedrals down there 's no in between there is no man who is redefined to mean woman and if there were that would not be a very good man and what does that mean it means that it is actually a duty of women to allow men to be men just as it is a duty of men to allow women to be women just as it is a fact that it is a form of appropriation for men to pretend to be women and take on all these supposedly female characteristics and it 's a mockery when women do the same with regard to masculinity that is also bad it is also wrong men and women are complimentary and the single best articulation of this comes in the book of genesis when god creates woman he creates woman and says that she is azer kenegdo,0.3121,mr . taylor said and surprisingly this is playing into not just one story but a couple the idea that deceased people are being registered to vote and that non - citizens are being registered to vote because it looks like there 's some evidence to suggest that may be true the numbers are not necessarily staggering it 's not like we have millions of people but it is happening but now let us take a look at what abc reported back in august that non - citizens were actually registered to vote on more than one occasion according to abc non - citizens registered to vote in texas some cast ballots hundreds if not thousands of non - us citizens are registered to vote in texas and some have cast ballots in elections wfa discovered what 's interesting is that this story is from august and what we are learning about the mailers that were just sent out is from only a few days ago which means there have been people who are not citizens registered to vote for a while now even before these mailings were sent out we now know for sure that non - citizens are voting the question is how many and how big of an issue it is said state senator donna fiends are dallas direct - action texas a conservative grassroots organization originally made the claim at a news conference in farmers branch last week turns out it 's true non - citizens are registered to vote in texas and the bureaucracy is partially to blame the texas secretary of state said efforts are underway right now to improve the voter database and determine the exact number of non - citizens currently eligible to vote we think it 's very likely we have had non - citizens cast ballots texas attorney general ken paxton said we had vet in tarrant county we prosecuted somebody who had done that and they ended up in prison for eight years rosa ortega 37 is the mother from mexico who received the eight - year sentence ortega is a green card holder who said she twice voted for republicans moraga told the judge who sentenced her that she do not understand she could not vote in a may email dallas county elections administrator tony pippins poole revealed a sliver of the problem after huffy ins requested data in an email to the senator pippins poole wrote that since 2011 174 voter registrations have been canceled for non citizenship of those 174 canceled for non citizenship 22 voted in 38 various elections election dates range from 3 8 1988 to 11 8 2016 here 's the worst part the woman who was sentenced to prison probably do not know she was doing anything wrong she may have received a mailer saying you should register to vote and you can as we learned from the ap story many people were calling in confused thinking that something had changed and they were now eligible to vote is that what happened with this 37 year old woman i can not necessarily blame the individual if they receive what looks like official mail saying you are allowed to vote and then going and voting it 's crazy that she 's getting eight years in prison for it but election security is a huge issue and at the end of the day the responsibility falls in the individual to know whether or not they are breaking the law i do believe some leniency is in order for this woman especially now that we are learning the democrats were sending out these forms to non - citizens who probably do not understand it was from a political party i am sure some of them did but just think about it there 's probably some people who are here legally who have green cards who have no idea what this means and do not realize it 's not an official document so they mail it in they go and vote and then it turns out they broke the law some of the responsibility has to fall on the people who are sending these migrants these league resonance forms telling them they can vote it was not just texas according to abc news 1500 non - citizens may have been registered to vote in california dmv error the department of motor vehicles admitted monday a mistake caused as many as 1500 non - citizens being registered to vote in the state the agency was alerted to the mistake when randall markey a canadian citizen and legal permanent resident in the u.s . went to the los angeles times to tell them about receiving a piece of mail from the dmv saying he was registered to vote i am sure there are many non - citizens who know full,0.2996,well there 's a problem with order if you look at the history of the 20th century it 's a toss up whether mother nature has been harder on us or whether our governmental traditions have been harder on us you know of course that the dictatorship of hitler killed 6 million jews 120 million people in the second world war you may not know that the stalinist dictatorships in the soviet union killed an estimated 60 million people in internal repression not counting those people who died in the second world war and the internal repression that characterized ma communist china killed a 100 million people and so the problem with tradition is that sometimes it 's a wise king and sometimes it 's a king that eats its own sons which means that although we need tradition to guide us and to structure even the manner in which we perceive the world world our traditions can become archaic and outdated and cruel and inhuman and as a consequence they can pose a worse threat to us than chaos itself nature or chaos is exactly the same dichotomous structure the figure on the left is a medusa or a gorgon if you look at a medusa as you probably already know you turn to stone the reason you turn to stone is because when you look upon nature or chaos without your normal veils it paralyzes you physiologically just like a prey animal like a rabbit is terrified if it sees a wolf for millions of years human beings were prey animals we were probably prey animals for large reptiles which accounts for example for the reason that it appears that primates like us are naturally afraid of predatory reptiles if you are in the presence of something that violates your assumptions of safety you will freeze you freeze so that the thing that might eat you can not see you and that 's what turns you to stone that 's nature and its terrible aspect and the terrible aspect of nature can freeze everyone and you can be sure and will be seldom taught that you will encounter that at some point in your life the primary buddhist dictum is that life is suffering and what does that mean it means that because you are finite and you are surrounded by something that 's absolute in a sense you are in a battle that you can never win because there 's always more of what it is that you are trying to contend with than there is with you and worse than that and it 's for this reason that tyrannies can not last is that the thing that you are contending with is not even static it keeps changing so that what worked for you yesterday will not necessarily work for you tomorrow this is an alchemical version of the dst yin and yang symbol and basically it says something that 's more sophisticated and complex it says that the world 's made up of chaos and order things that you can predict and understand and things that you can not predict and can not understand and inside the order there 's some chaos and inside that chaos there 's some order and inside that order there 's some chaos and so on and so forth and equally the case for or order you have mother nature representation of chaos sometimes positive sometimes negative you have a representation of the great father that 's security and tyranny two things you will always have to contend with and finally in this representation you have a representation of the individual at least a christian representation of the individual and that 's christ and it 's a terrifying representation it 's a remarkable rep representation because it 's not a representation of transcendence it 's a representation of suffering and it 's a funny kind of representation of suffering because the manner in which the story unfolds is this christ as the archetypal individual the model for individuals from a psychological or mythological perspective knows that he 's limited and knows that he 's doomed to both suffering and death in the garden of gethsemane the night before his crucifixion he has an argument with god in the argument basically is uh do i actually have to do this and the answer is twofold,0.2131,i i do not care what your title say i do not care what your denomination say the bottom line is that if you can take that bible and you can read for yourself because if you are in a religion that tells you not to read your bible you you you something something wrong you should be able to go to your church or your mos i mean not mos go to a mosque go to your church go to the temple go to the cathedral whatever you wherever you going to and you should be able to look at that bible and read it for yourself when you get home and you should be able to follow what jesus said if your priest died today and your pastor di today and the church closed down your faith should still be secure because you should have a personal relationship with jesus christ your relationship should not be proxy through a man that 's for protestant catholic mormon whatever you want to call yourself but you should be able to pick that bible up and be able to read that bible and read what jesus said and follow what he said you can do what i just said if you are a catholic if you a whatever whatever because at the end of the day a lot of this stuff is religion it do not have nothing to do with the bible so just because you doing hell mares or you putting ashes on your forehead that i do not that has nothing to do with the bible that 's a religious practice which is fine as long as you are not doing something that jesus told you not to do you can practice that religiously if you going and you know if if you do not believe that this man has the authority to forgive your sins or not this one man if you are doing any religious practice for uh tradition and you go confess your sins to this person but you still understand that you can go and confess your sins to your brother or you can go and talk to jesus if you understand that then who cares if you go and confess in a booth that that that who cares i do not care i honestly believe that people should make sure that they have a personal relationship with christ and that 's what matters more than any denomination you know if i had to say i think people who are identified catholic will go to heaven people some people who are apostolic and baptist and and church of god christ and sday advanage and jews and i think some other people they would they would go to heaven when i say jews i mean messianic jews i am talking about jews that believe in jesus christ um the jews that do not believe in jesus christ according to the bible in the book of romans there will come a day that every knee shall bow and they would have to confess that jesus is lord and they will be saved that 's what the bible says about the jewish people about god chosen people israel now i do not know who those people are specifically but the bible prophesied that it 's a number,0.4096,we all knew that donald trump has been winning over and over again and that this would make democrats desperate i just do not know how low the democrats would stoop in their desperation to defeat donald trump and now we can see it they have signed the deal with the devil now you can call the republican party evil because you disagree with their politics but that 's kind of that 's kind of silly we all disagree with other people on policy and think one person is good or evil but there 's a big difference with what the democrats are doing with michael bloomberg you see bloomberg is not just buying ads to win the presidency he 's straight up buying the democratic party he 's pumping millions into democratic house candidates he 's funding lawyers in state ag offices and he directly gave the party and their packs a substantial amount of money all of a sudden they change the rules for him they let him on the debate stage and now he 's qualified they have opened the door because he paid them cold hard cash a man who 's worth substantially more than donald trump who 's been embroiled in much more much harsher political controversies as a republican mayor in new york city the democrats are so desperate and terrified they are absolutely embracing the cold hard cash of michael bloomberg but i will tell you why i say they become the party of corruption and evil because they are defending the man they have thrown all principle out the window any statement they have ever made about getting money out of politics is now completely without merit because they are actively defending bloomberg and his massive spending i am not kidding stacey abrams received 5 million dollars for her pac from michael bloomberg and is defending him on the view with misinformation nonetheless bloomberg will not be disclosing where his money is going and where it 's coming from not until after super tuesday so here you have a man of massive wealth buying his way in propping up democrats and left - wing causes and they gladly take the money and defend him even on the view i am not talking about progressive activists because they are pushing back it 's the democratic establishment and high - profile democratic voters and personalities it 's fine we will take whatever we can get because they are that desperate to win i have the story from the hill democrats worried about trump 's growing strength but i do not want to read this to you i want to show you this is an example of their fear and how they are willing to do whatever it takes what i really want to show you is this from new york magazine michael bloomberg has offered democrats a faustian bargain forfeit all credibility on the issues of money and politics and democratic reform and he will spend whatever it takes to make trump go away they 'd be fools to accept it there are still many people in media and on the left saying stop but it 's too late he gave massive amounts of money to house democrats to win against their republican counterparts and moderate districts he 's given money to the democratic party and now he has been welcomed on the stage and high - profile celebrities endorse it let us read this story but before we do head over to tim cast calm / done it if you 'd like to support my work that several ways you can give but the best thing you can do is share this video it may not break any echo chambers but i think it 's fair to say if you are a bernie sanders supporter if you are a progressive leftist democratic socialist someone on the left you are probably going to be in agreement with a trump supporter when you recognize that michael bloomberg is a serious threat to democracy in this country the mainstream democrats the establishment they do not care they just want to win but i will tell you this and we will read this story donald trump for all of his faults for everything i do not like or dislike about him or disagree with is a legitimate president now they have tried to claim russia gate and ukraine gained all these other scandals but let us be real donald trump won he did if it they do not think you would no one thought he would but he did win he do not spend hundreds of millions of dollars he actually fought against the republican establishment he do not buy it michael bloomberg was actually in office in new york when he when he implemented extremely let us just say troubling policies targeting minorities and poor people and he defends it he actually calls for taxing the poor the democrats are willing to embrace all of this which shows me they have no principle they have sold them what 's fascinating is it really is a faustian bargain as the new york new york mag says and this is from the intelligencer a paper i typically take issue with but it 's true michael bloomberg is everything they claim to hate he is everything they claim donald trump is but worse and he said i will give you the money and then you make me the president so let me let me let me explain and then worry this there 's a big difference between the koch brothers or soros or some high - profile billionaire funding programs bloomberg is a man who wants the office itself he is telling them to give up their position to him it 's not an issue of someone who 's rich funding causes is an issue of someone rich buying the seat and they are doing it they are giving it let us read so at the intelligencer we have from eric levitz writing mike bloomberg has offered america a faustian bargain forfeit all credibility on issues of money in politics and democratic reform and he will spend whatever it takes to make the bad man in the white house go away the market for what bloomberg is selling is a large and growing thanks in no small small part to the 300 million dollars he 's already spent advertising it many rank - and - file democrats like so many disillusioned voters and democracies the world over like the idea of hiring a no - nonsense post political businessman to fix their broken broken government meanwhile many democratic elites see bloomberg as a savior who can single - handedly stop the party nominating a supposedly unelectable socialist provide its vulnerable first term suburban house members with an ideal standard - bearer and liberate the party from all resource constraints and fundraising headaches as it rides a rising tide of billionaire bucks back into power but democrats would be fools to accept bloomberg 's indecent proposal i am not an anti big dollar donor purist removing an increasingly lawless openly racist president from power is more integral to realizing our nation 's democratic promise than keeping our sides fec records pristine bloomberg has said that he 's willing to put his well - heeled campaign operation behind the democratic nominee this fall even if that nominee proves to be a self about socialist if the former mayor is telling the truth if he is truly willing to choose social democracy over barbarism and bankroll a democratic candidate who is openly hostile to the billionaire class then democrats should probably take his money and run but accepting of plutocrats patronage and letting your party serve as a vehicle for him to amass direct personal power over our government are two very different propositions and that was a very biased and verbose way to say what i just did it 's one thing if a rich person gives donations it 's another thing if he wants the seat the seat itself and you give it up the terrifying reality of the democratic party is they have become well they have been preparing for this this transformation do not happen overnight i did a video talking about democrats selling their soul but the reality is as i have learned they already have a long time ago voxcom democrats are replacing republicans as the preferred party of the very wealthy this is from vox vox is an outlet it recently published a piece called the case for michael bloomberg you see back in 2016 they noticed this that it used to be republicans were perceived as the party for the very wealthy and the democrats were for the poor the minorities the working - class not anymore not at all it 's a strangest thing to me we seem to have two factions on the left you have the woke ideologues who believe that serena williams is oppressed even though she 's worth millions of dollars and a poor homeless white man is the oppressor that is insane backwards thinking but the other alternative is the bloomberg elites the people who have sold their souls to the devil for a chance to win political power these are the two predominant factions where are the sane moderates representing the democratic party i am sorry they are gone and that 's why people like me who used to be in favor of these ideas are now called politically homeless i will show you this story mike several stories i am sorry mike bloomberg to donate ten million dollars to house democrats targeted by the gop you see the man do not just want to buy access he wanted to buy out all of them and it 's working the best example being stacey abrams and i will get to that stacey abrams defending what he 's doing why he gave her five million dollars i am not kidding he actually gave five million dollars to her pack and all sudden she says bloomberg 's doing the right thing that 's right that 's called corruption that is literally corruption well everybody wants to justify why they took the money everyone thinks they are morally justified in doing these things they say god 's on my side or at least when i am in power i can do the right thing and that 's how it always plays out with these utopianist s-- they think bloomberg might be bad,0.5718,smollett chicago police said sunday they are still seeking a follow - up interview as jesse smollett after receiving new information that shifted their investigation of a reported attack on the empire actor police spokesman anthony guglielmo said we are not confirming denying or commenting on anything until we can talk to him and we can corroborate some information that we have gotten the next update from tmz is that the jussie smollett case to go to grand jury this means he naturally be indicted for a crime and we did hear previously that police would seek to prosecute him if it turned out to be a hoax additionally jesse smollett received a threatening letter previously and it now seems that they are going to be investigating whether or not this was a hoax as well tmz reports we are told when police raided the home of the two brothers they found mad with pages torn out and authorities are now trying to determine if the missing pages are connected to the threatening letter that was sent to jessie eight days before the alleged attack they add we are told investigators do not believe the two alleged attackers screamed this is my go country because quote not a single trump supporter watches empire at this point it 's important to point out the police have not confirmed these details but many news outlets are covering this far and wide citing police sources and if we are going to trust even cnn it sounds like this is basically confirmed but keep in mind small at once said a few weeks ago i fought the eff back he maintained what was presumably a lie and even pushed and exaggerated his story later on but now what people on the right are looking for is retractions and apologies and there are a lot of people on the left who have come out and said this was wrong if he did this they will condemn him from the rap al sharpton says jesse 's small it should face accountability to the maximum if attack was staged if it is found that small it and these gentlemen did in some way perpetrate something that is not true they ought to face accountability to the maximum the msnbc host and civil rights leader said during a sunday airing of his program politics nation but although there are others who have come out and condemned jesse smollett for potentially perpetrating this hoax some people either do not want to say anything dispute the new reporting or just deleted their tweets from the daily mail nancy pelosi deletes a tweet saying attack on actor jesse smollett was an affront to humanity after allegations the empire star staged homophobic and racist attack to save his job in her tweet she added no one should be attacked for who they are or whom they love i pray that jesse has a speedy recovery and that justice is served may we all commit to ending this hate once and for all now i would agree with nancy pelosi we should end this hate in reference to hoax hate crimes because they do a disservice to actual victims and they only make the problems worse they sow distrust when people try and make these claims and then we have this story cory booker says he will not comment further on the smaller case until more information comes out but remember he initially used the story of jesse smollett to advocate for a bill that he was pushing to make lynching a hate crime federally now that we are here reporting he may have faked this crime cory booker is refusing to say anything so you could definitely see the bias but that 's to be expected cory booker is on the left but now to the more important point the gas sliding julio rojas on twitter tweeted boxes liz plank on this is my country quote saying the people who are repeating that quote were not news outlets it was repeated by sure people who maybe had good intentions of wanting to spread the story we can not confuse celebrity tweets with media and the press brian stelter then says so you are saying actors and activists who were rushing to his side because they were friends with him and they supported him are not the same as chicago reporters who are trying to find out what happened stelter added there was a rush to judgment i think it was mostly in the celebrity press and among activists and among twitter people i think it was a really careful reporting by news organizations but it all gets lumped in together at the end of the day this rhetoric is repeated by wesley lowery of the washington post who adds in a tweet journalists relayed smaltz claim and initial police statements seemingly backing it journals are not the villain here dave weigel of the washington post added twitter often blurs the media into a blob of celebrities pundits and randos and it does a disservice to the reporters who covered this story right away there are many journalists from actual news organizations particularly in chicago who did an outstanding job covering the story and it would seem that they were right every step of the way very early on a local chicago reporter said that police sources doubt the veracity of these claims he actually deleted this tweet but it turned out he was likely correct the police did doubt this presumably but more importantly they are actually investigating it would seem jesse small its claims as a hoax but it 's not true that journalists across the board did a good job it 's not true at brian stelter what wesley lowery or david weigel are saying journalists absolutely pushed fake news but here 's a more important point maybe what they are saying is true maybe now brian stelter wesley lowery and david weigel are admitting that many of these news organizations are in fact activist organizations because as it turns out media i put together a huge list of people we would presume to be journalists acting as activists and if what brian stelter says is true he actually does not see the people as journalists he sees them as activists or just personalities unfortunately they work for news organizations so it would appear that he 's wrong for mediaite did the media jump the gun on the jussie smollett story this is from caleb how in light of new details in the investigation of the alleged assault on actor jesse smollett fingers have been pointed at the media for jumping the gun on the story in pushing back against it there 's an emerging effort to draw distinction between rapid - fire activists and celebrities on social media and members of the press he makes reference to what liz plank said about the mago country incident and adds this is a fine idea and there should be some distinction when referring to the media at large but in this case the facts simply do not bear out the premise that the press was not involved in an early pile on in fact dozens of reporters tweeted these very things on the day the story broke these are only some of the examples take a look at these reporters / members of the press / journalists from the new york post saying i also hate when cops investigate this kind of blatant s as a possible hate crime this is obviously a hate crime a newsweek writer saying empire star just a small victim of homophobic attack by mogga supporters the daily beast reporting people in mogga hats recognized and attacked him we have a writer from boeing boeing jenny jardine saying trump owns this donald trump supporters owned this everyone will allows racist and homophobic words to go unchecked owns this we have philadelphia magazine trump magus of porters came after a black gay man with a news in chicago vibe nightline on abc news jessi smollett beaten in homophobic attack by mogga supporters empire cast getting armed guards not true we have forbes and slate the la times and gadget buzzfeed reuters teen vogue in the washington post with a contributor to cosmopolitan rolling stone ap and abc news the village voice in the guardian huffington post the washington post vanity fair we have a fox 32 anchor and reporter ross story he says that one was shared with headline by this guy who writes about the spread of fake news paul leary and some freelance journalists another factor that is not addressed in the media who retweet or share the tweets from celebrities and activists there were a lot of famous people tweeting the day including politicians and members of the media shared their tweets cory doctorow howard dean a hillary clinton strategist a democratic coalition the list goes on and on and if i was going to read all of it it might take too long,0.281,so the big controversy of the day obviously surrounds the passage of this alabama law so alabama has now moved to pass a law that effectively bans abortion in the state unlike the law in georgia that is a heartbeat bill and says that for the first six weeks of pregnancy you can get an abortion effectively on demand and then beyond six weeks you can not and then it punishes abortion doctors the alabama law goes even further the alabama law goes right to the heart of the matter and says that the unborn are human lives it says that they have the status of persons under alabama law and this challenge is directly over wait roe vs. wade says no these are not persons instead these are basically developing some things and that means that based on viability standards you can kill a baby or you can not kill a baby based on viability standards or states can pass laws that prevent the killing of the unborn depending on viability and that the standard is incredibly murky under roe vs. wade and then it gets even murky or under planned parenthood versus casey which is a case from the late 1980s early 1990s has moved its way up through the courts in which the court basically ruled to limit roe vs. wade but wade and said that you can not pass a law that creates an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion the undue burden standard has always been quite vague and my forecast has been that the supreme court with the new republican appointed majority would start paring back at planned parenthood versus casey but would not overturn roe v wade it would leave in place the idea that a woman has a quote unquote right to an abortion but it would pare back at the lengths to which that right extends i think that is still the likeliest path for the supreme court alabama is challenging it outright however they have passed a law now that says abortion is banned in our state and abortion doctors can go to jail anywhere from 10 years to 99 years and life begins at conception has a full pro - life bill now a lot of people on the right are uncomfortable with the pro the the full pro - life bill many of them are uncomfortable mainly i think because of the optics so the bill does not have an exception for rape and incest which makes logical sense i know that it does not make a lot of emotional sense for people they are saying well you know a woman gets raped and now she has the burden of carrying this child to term you are right it is a a grave burden on the woman that she has to do this which is why it 's an act of heroism for any woman to carry that child to term what that said if you believe that a human life is a human life in the womb the fact that a grave wrong was done to initiate the creation of that life does not mean that the life itself is of no value there 's a logical distinction between the evil that was done to create the life in the first place and the presence of the life now that the life is present that 's why i have always been in favor of an exception in case of serious danger to the mother and that would include mental health the woman is going to go crazy and harm herself for example if a woman is going to to be so depressed that you become suicidal then abortion in my view becomes an option because now the more the mother 's life is in danger and you stake her life against the life of the human life in her womb alabama i think by the way does the right thing from a pro - life perspective when it comes to rape and incest concessions with regard to rape and incest have always been sort of a stop to public opinion rather than a principled stand about the value of human life they also opened the door to the argument,0.6679,i am pretty sure vladimir putin is like missiles i mean he already did that he already put his nuclear forces on high alert we better trade carefully here president vladimir putin will send a doomsday warning to the west when he leads celebrations on monday marking the 77th anniversary of the soviet union 's victory over nazi germany brandishing russia 's vast firepower while its forces fight on in ukraine defiant in the face of deep western isolation since he ordered the invasion of russia 's neighbor putin will speak on red square before parade of troops tanks rockets and intercontinental ballistic missiles interesting a fly past over saint basil 's cathedral will include supersonic fighters tu-160 strategic bombers and for the first time since 2010 the ill-80 doomsday command plane which would carry russia 's top brass in the event of a nuclear war the defense ministry said in that scenario the il-80 or the il-80 is designed to become the roaming command center for the russian president it is packed with technology but specific details are russian state secrets the 69 year old kremlin leader has repeatedly likened the war in ukraine to the challenge the soviet union faced when adolf hitler 's not season invaded in 1941 the attempt to appease the aggressor on the eve of the great patriotic war turned out to be a mistake that cost our people dearly putin said on february 24th when he announced what he called a special military operation in ukraine we will not make such a mistake a second time we have no right and that 's important how is russia framing this conflict you heard it right there vladimir putin is likening what 's happening to appeasing hitler and then waiting for hillar to invade and this is omitted from much of the standard mainstream context over the war they say putin is just he 's hitler trying to steal land not so simple ukraine going to nato or the eu would be an expanse that vladimir putin is not willing to tolerate i believe invading was wrong but his argument is if we sit back they will invade us welcome to war man this is why i oppose it because it 's just getting to the point where everyone just starts attacking and then there 's destruction and we see these beautiful cities of ukraine start to crumble and it is sad to see putin cast the war in ukraine as a battle to protect russian speakers there from persecution by nazis and to guard against what he terms the u.s threat to russia posed by nato enlargement ukraine and the west dismiss the fascism claim as nonsense and say putin is waging an unprovoked war of aggression well whether or not you want to have the opinion of the united states government or the russia russian government look the point is the u.s was playing soft - powered games joe biden is a criminal and that contributed to this i i think we could have avoided all of this if we just brought in donald trump that nato would have had its defenses shored up russia would not have invaded because the question is simple why did russia wait until after donald trump got out of office to invade why did he not invade during trump 's presidency two reasons vladimir putin feared trump at least a little bit and trump was doing right internationally he was getting rid of isis he was stabilizing the middle east not completely i am not saying every problem but the abraham accords many people say thanks to jared kushner were great there were great things happening under trump the world was healing so why would vladimir putin invade when good things were happening now the how does the left and the establishment of the u.s frame it trump was appeasing vladimir putin,0.5914,she 's ahead in michigan by 11 donald trump is only winning north carolina by two she 's winning wisconsin by two and donald trump is winning pennsylvania by four now if those results actually held and let us say that donald trump won georgia then donald trump presumably if he lost arizona would still lose the election if those results were to hold now here is the big grain of salt how do you have a swing state poll in which donald trump is winning pennsylvania by four but losing michigan by 11 like a 15 - point gap between michigan and pennsylvania i find this one a little hard to believe and morning consult polls are either genius or they are total crap those are the only two plausible explanations here with that said the levels of enthusiasm for kla harris among democrats are obviously jumping that is not a shock because again when you replace a dead person with a live person that makes a little bit of a difference according to a new ap nrcp poll about eight and 10 democrats are now satisfied with k harris that was like four in 10 democrats who were satisfied when it was joe biden so all the democrats are coming home which basically means that we are at where we were before the first debate between joe biden and donald trump that effectively ended both joe biden 's candidacy and his presidency because let us be real about this that dude is no longer president he 's no longer sentient he 's completely irrelevant to the public to the public square the the only reason he is sticking around is as a sop to him as like elder statesman and we are now finding out that when they do the democratic national convention in a couple of weeks that it 's the first night is going to be all about the magic of joe biden he 's going to give the opening speech it 's going to be about the incredible performance of the joe biden administration and then it will turn into the celebrity star studded celebration of kamla harris with that said where does the race currently stand according to nate silver who again i think is the best poll analyst in the country he says that right now kla harris has a better than average chance of winning the popular vote but a worse than average chance of winning the electoral college according to his model right now harris has about a 54 % shot at winning the popular vote because she 's going to drive up the vote in big cities particularly in blue areas she 's going to win about 47.7 % of the vote trump would win about 47.1 but in the electoral college trump currently has about a 6040 vantage over kamla harris according to nate silver so this is very much a a competitive race harris does have some momentum although again there 's a new harvard harris poll that came out yesterday showing trump up four against kl harris so the polls are a little bit all over the place still very volatile and kla harris has not been asked a single question a lot of enthusiasm for kamla which is incredibly stupid because she 's terrible but you know what 's not stupid getting life

bitcoin i own some ethereum i own it as a long - term investment i had no intention of selling it in the short term because again the whole point of bitcoin is that it is a digital limited resource they are not generating more of so it 's sort of like digital real estate so if you hold on to it long enough then the price will go back up however the cryptocurrency market is sliding and people are trying to access that capital by selling off bitcoin felt with 31 000 on monday evening a 10 drop from sunday at 5 pm eastern time according to prices from coindesk bitcoin 's price has fallen 57 54 from its record high of 67 000 in november 67 800 actually in november and that of course was due to the inflationary worries it 's now on track for the worst five - day stretch since the five days ending march 16th 2020 when it fell almost 38 as you will recall that was the very beginning of the pandemic ethereum also fell to 2286 bucks almost 10 percent below the price on sunday evening so digital assets again people are looking for more solid assets they are simply stocking dollars up at this point and and this is what financial advisors are telling people to do i mean according to the wall street journal doing nothing right now is easier said than done but that 's what you should be doing the best strategy and moments of volatility is one financial advisors say that is wonderfully satisfying do not do anything when losses mount it 's human nature to want to do something behavioral economics has shown but when does it pay to act when should traditional portfolios be scrapped advisors say whether you do nothing or do something may depend primarily if you are closer in age two to king lear or cordelia in other words for younger investors if you do not have to access the capital do not access the capital just leave it there this is correct i have told i have told people for a long time buy assets leave your assets there if you are younger if you are you should be risk seeking when you are young that is the time to do it but here 's the bottom line for joe biden none of this is good news all this is really really bad news and no one believes joe biden when he says that his top priority is fighting inflation because until five seconds ago he was denying that inflation was even a pressing problem and then he was blaming on vladimir putin and supply chain crises so nobody believes that this this president can fix any of this or has any intention of fixing any of this again one of the things that you watch in the investment market is that when the market goes down rich people get a lot richer because they buy up all the assets like if you have taken my advice back in march 2020 you would have done great when the market tumbled in march 2020 i told my investment advisors to double whatever i was investing in the stock market because when the market goes down that 's when you buy i told everybody go back and listen to the podcast i told everybody when the market dumped at the beginning of covid if you could afford it now is the time to buy more into the market because eventually it would be worth more and certainly do not sell,0.6244,on wednesday facebook 's oversight board of the overlords the fake independent supreme court of facebook bans ruled that president trump 's ban will stay and that it was justified because as you know he said certain things about the democrats that the democrats were saying about him after he won in 2016 and that 's not allowed jen circle back saki one of all joe 's caretakers then said that more censorship needs to be done because people are still exercising their first amendment on social media facebook has decided to keep former president trump off of its platform for now senator ted cruz tweeted the following for every liberal celebrating trump 's social media ban if the big tech oligarchs can muzzle the former president what 's to stop them from silencing you what do you make of that comment does he have a point well let me first say that um this is an independent board 's decision and we are not going to have any comment on the future of the former president 's social media platform the president 's view is that um the major platforms have a responsibility related to the health and safety of all americans to stop amplifying untrustworthy content disinformation and misinformation especially related to covet 19 vaccinations and elections so his view is that there 's more that needs to be done to ensure that this type of misinformation disinformation damaging sometimes life - threatening information is not going out to the american public i do not think there 's a single american citizen who expected that the oversight board would have allowed him back on facebook i guess some of the democrats feared that they might but it 's obvious that they never were they are just making it appear as if this phony independent body reviewed the decision although they said it 's not a lifetime ban it 's just for six months and then in six months they will revisit their decision and then they will make it official that he 's never allowed back because he 's still spreading misinformation on his own website we can not allow that on facebook also this week in censorship facebook banned lifesight news a popular christian pro - life website they were banned from youtube back in february and now facebook completely banned them rumor has it because they are posting certain statistics about the vaccine that you are not supposed to talk about by the way i have been in contact with kyle rittenhouse 's lawyer and i recommended that he submit kyle 's case to the facebook oversight board and attempts to try to get that page reinstated because as you probably know his page was banned upon his arrest his false arrest for defending himself as you know facebook decided that he 's guilty until proven innocent and gave me a community guideline strike and censored one of my posts where i showed a video of kyle helping put on a fire that the rioters had started because you are not allowed to show him in a positive light at all literally that 's their policy you are not allowed to prs praise represent or support anybody who 's been added to their dangerous persons list somebody who 's still allowed to have their facebook page however is bryce gage watkins who was arrested for allegedly doing the most horrific thing a human being could do to a child and he allegedly recorded that abuse and sent the video to others through facebook messenger and he was arrested thankfully he 's still in jail but his facebook page is still up so if he 's allowed god forbid out on bail he could continue to use his page so apparently sending child abuse allegedly through facebook messenger is not a violation of facebook 's terms of service but kyle rittenhouse acting in self - defense is after his arrest some of the articles linked directly to his facebook page and i was absolutely stunned to see that it was still up so i started tweeting to andy stone facebook 's public relations guy over on twitter along with many other people once they saw the pages still love we started asking him you know why is this page up after he 's been arrested for allegedly sending child abuse through facebook 's messenger and andy stone do not respond here it is months later the page is still up which leads me to only one conclusion that facebook does not have a problem with that and new research confirms what 's previously been reported that facebook was the primary platform that people use to organize the events of january 6th at the capitol but of course they are never going to get banned from the app store like parlor was meanwhile mark zuckerberg has become one of the most despised people on planet earth so last year alone facebook spent 25 million dollars on security for him that 's 2 million dollars a month that 's over 68 000 a day on security to protect mark zuckerberg president trump just updated his website the desk of donald trump which is sort of looking like it 's going to be a blog and maybe even a vlog as well with him posting some videos he 'd been posting some press releases on a fairly regular basis but it looks like it 's going to be a little more active now so somebody started a twitter account for him just a fan account it certainly was not him the desk of donald trump started mirroring the posts over there and then people started complaining about it and one of the top trends on twitter was calling for people to ban president trump he 's trying to return to twitter and the account was immediately suspended senator josh hawley just came out with a new book called the tyranny of big tech which is all about social media censorship and despite fox news and other conservative media outlets just keeping lavish praise onto him he do not even make it into amazon 's top 10 bestseller list my last book made it to number three by the way and i am just a guy in my kitchen on a laptop i told you guys that after the election regardless of the outcome that i was going to take the gloves off and stop being nice to republicans because we need to hold them accountable and senator holly we pay you to write bills not to write books maybe instead of writing a book trying to make some quick cash you could have you know done your job like maybe write a letter to the tsa asking why they put nick fuentes on the no fly list even though he do not even enter the capitol on january 6th maybe instead of writing a book on the taxpayers dime,0.17,and we do not have enough evidence thus far as to what the actual effect of the variance is going to be on vaccinated populations which is why we are rushing to vaccinate people right now nonetheless the media are fully invested in panic mode and remain invested in panic mode because number one it 's good for business and number two they are invested in the idea that centralized government is the solution to all ills because once the government has centralized all power then the government can do everything you want the government to do every crisis is an opportunity as rahm emanuel barack obama 's former chief of staff and former mayor of chicago once said so reuters is reporting that chris murray a university of washington disease expert whose projections on cover 19 infections and deaths are closely followed worldwide is changing his assumptions about the course of the pandemic murray had until recently been hopeful that the discovery of several affected vaccines could help countries achieve herd immunity or nearly eliminate transmission through a combination of inoculation and previous infection but in the last month data from a vaccine trail in south africa showed not only that a rapidly spreading covet variant could dampen the effect of the vaccine it could also evade natural immunity in people who had previously been infected well if that is the case then you literally can not do anything you have now talked about a disease that you can not create immunity to right it just comes back around it 's like a common cold it just comes back around and the vaccine ai not going to work on it so what exactly is supposed to do lock yourself in your house for the rest of time he says i could not sleep he 's the director of the institute for health metrics and evaluation remember the ihme model which is really really off in the early days it 's basically a garbage ring garbage drop model it just takes prior data puts it in there and then makes assumptions makes the assumptions clear and then tosses out what it thinks will be the future sometimes it 's right and sometimes it 's wrong it certainly was not the best model that was out there a new consensus is emerging according to scientists according to reuters interviews many describes how the breakthrough late last year of two vaccines with around 95 efficacy against coca-19 had initially sparked hope the virus could be largely contained similar to the way measles has been but they say now it looks like this is going to be an endemic virus it will circulate in communities and it could cause a significant burden of illness and death for years to come as a result said scientists people could expect to continue to take measures such as routine mask wearing and avoiding crowded places during covet-19 surges especially for people at high risk dr fauci says i would still want to wear a mask if there was a variant out there all you need is one little flick of a variant sparking another surge and there goes your prediction about when life gets back to normal murray says that if the south african variant or similar mutants continue to spread rapidly the number of coven 19 cases resulting in hospitalization or death this coming winter could be four times higher than the flu now again it 's important to understand base rates here four times higher than the flu does not mean that we are looking at black plague type numbers the flu is indeed a dangerous disease but nobody has ever shut down society for the flu we know that this particular disease has been something like five times more deadly than the flu and we also know that it spreads much more widely than the flu so if we now we are saying that the the amount of death total not the deadliness the amount of death is four times that of the flu without with a virus that is much more contagious and there 's not really a way of stopping it the only time that people are actively going to engage in the sort of measures we have been engaging in is if the health system is on the verge of being overwhelmed then we actually do not have evidence that that is the case anywhere in america right now it may happen and if that happens then maybe we will start taking these measures but in reality most people particularly young healthy people are not going to stop their lives stop dating stop going to parties stop going to ball games because a disease that mainly kills people over the age of 70 is still out there and is coming around seasonally especially since you have no cure for it,0.4654,and therefore if a child comes to you and expresses gender confusion or if a child even asks a simple question you must have a conversation offline with the child without the parents present because you know better than the parents what the kid needs and who knows mom and dad might be the absolute moral monsters who believe in things like the bible or natural law or who believe that their kids might just be gender confused or confused about their sexual orientation and who might need some time to grow out of it if you say that you are bad the left believes this this is why the left wants this stuff taught in schools because the left is engaged in a full - scale attempt to separate children off from the values of their parents and this is why they object to what florida is doing in this bill i have said for a long time i think that we are five minutes away if we are not already there from situations in states like california and new york and new jersey where kids go to school and they express any sort of sexual orientation or gender identity confusion or curiosity and teachers then immediately begin proceedings to indoctrinate kids in whatever their left - wing values are and then when parents refuse to go along with this kids are removed from the home by child cust by child protective services i think we are five seconds away from that why because we have already seen it in places like canada i think that what we are about to see unless the supreme court were to stop it i think what we are about to see is a full crackdown on religious freedom across the country and freedom of speech across the country on these issues in the name of quote - unquote anti - discrimination because the personal is political when it comes to the left and the political is personal when it comes to left they are one and the same which is the reason why they are so all fired upset about the idea that florida might ban indoctrination in sexual orientation and gender identity for small children and by the way get your kids out of the public school system immediately do not trust these people with your kids do not not unless you can take over the school districts entirely not unless you can take over the school board and monitor what your kids are learning because to pretend that teachers are not activists and that the aft which is the largest single teachers union in the united states is not filled with left - wing activists is to ignore reality and do not be gaslit by the people who are telling you that these are just apolitical folks who want to teach your kids how to do long division that is not true all you have to do is look at the nea newsletter all you have to do is look at the aft newsletter they are not hiding the ball the left has never been hiding the ball we have been blinding ourselves to this because it 's time consuming to go through everything your kids watch it 's the same thing when it comes to the generalized culture i pre - screen everything my kids watch i do because i have to i have no other choice because if i put on disney plus and they put on a random show they might be getting a lesson in transgenderism from disney if my kids put on a show from netflix the next thing i know they might be learning about two gay dads and my kids are eight five and two i do not want them doing that i will teach them the values that i want to teach them but you know what all that 's really time consuming it takes a lot of time and this is what the left knows they know that they know that people have lives and people have jobs and people have made the core assumption that no one would be evil enough to try and rip away children from the values of their parents on mass they know that you are counting on the basic decency of the people to whom you delegate your children they know that and that 's why they get very angry when you mention that you would like some oversight power this is why you have greg sargent writing in the washington post that he 's very upset about the possibility the teachers might feel nervous about what they teachers should always feel nervous about what they teach listen if they were not teaching my kids math properly they should feel nervous about that if they were not teaching my kids english properly they should feel nervous about that the most nervous people in america should be teachers since they have the most power in america i am delegating my most precious asset my children to teachers so you are damned,0.5272,11:44 locust street the planned parenthood in philadelphia i hope to see you there all right cory booker is drowning in the polls and trying to save himself now by out liberal in his opponents and he just unveiled a massive anti second amendment plan which i will allow an article new york times to describe almost like a so this is what the new york times says about booker 's plans those aspects of mr . booker 's fourteen part plan are among the most progressive gun control measures suggested by candidates seeking the democratic nomination for president and are likely to face sharp criticism from gun rights advocates like the national rifle association mr . booker said in a statement my plan to address gun violence is simple we will make it harder for people who should not have a gun to get one i am sick and tired of having of hearing thoughts and prayers to the communities that have been shattered by gun violence while you have to make a false choice there between thoughts and prayers and this but the most notable piece of mr . booker 's plan is the proposed gun licensing program which would enact minimum standards for gun ownership nationwide under such a program a person seeking to buy a gun we need to apply for a license in much the same way that one applies for passport mr . booker 's campaigns that the process would involve submitting fingerprints and sitting for an interview and would require applicants to complete a certified gun safety course each applicant would also undergo a federal background check before being issued a gun license which would be valid for up to five years so you have to go and do this every five years we are interviewed you get fingerprints well i assume the fingerprints they would only do the one time you you think a gun safety course i do not know if you do that every five years other parts of the plan would include banning bumped stocks which enables semi - automatic weapons to fire faster limiting bulk purchases of firearms closing loopholes that allow domestic abusers and people on terror watchlist to obtain guns and the plan calls for the irs to investigate the nra raise tax exempt status so we are lumping that into this is just a goodie bag of a grab bag of far - left initiatives booker also said if you need a license to drive a car you should need a license to own a gun and that 's kind of how he summarizes his plan here now the plan also involves gun confiscation which is something that democrats always say they are not interested in doing but before we get to that part of it as for this idea of everyone having to get a federal license to own a gun there are two things number one if you need a license to drive a car you should need one to own a gun that is a total non sequitur,0.5305
day probably you know most of them are unseen you know uh i am not going to say i encounter racism people know who i am police know who i am everybody knows who i am so i probably get a pass on a lot of things um that friends family members people i associate with people i love go through all the time because they are not ice cube um but you know i have had you know i have had an insurance company drop me because um they do not like my point of view you know things like that um are you mad about it do you ever are you mad at people for their skin color ever in the course of a day um i am not mad at people because of their skin color you know i am mad at people because of what they do and the things they choose not to do right um there 's a big problem in this country with the financial banking system and black people and our access to capital you know i know that when it breaks down we have you know 13 to 15 % of the country trying to live off of half a percentage of wealth you know .5,0.1022,but it 's not going to be based on any sort of criminal conviction meanwhile three in five voters say joe biden should not run for a second term only one and two say the same for trump so that means 59 % say that joe biden should not run only half say that donald trump should not run about 58 % say they 'd consider a third- party candidate but when it comes to a head - to - head right now here 's the head - to - head biden versus gop nominees horse race if the 2024 election for president were held today and it was between trump the republican and biden the democrat who would you vote for that stat today is trump plus seven 48 to 41 11 % undecided if you include people leaning one way or the other this is why this is a critical poll actually it 's the first poll i have seen that has donald trump significantly over 50 % this harvard harris poll has donald trump up six at 53 to 47 which is a blowout for donald trump if this is a three - way race and you include robert f kennedy trump is still up eight 41 for trump 34 for biden 8 % for do not know unsure 177 % for rfk jr if you include leeners trump is still up 8 % he 's still up 8 % if you include for example jill stein or cornell west by the way that the the entire case just po speaking again this is coming from somebody who when a primary would vote for ronda sanis above donald trump but the reality is what these polls are showing is serious durability for donald trump against joe biden why the answer is because people know trump he 's a known quantity people have already factored in all of his flaws all of his foibles all of the crazy all that stuff is already baked into the cake and so it 's very difficult to think what could donald trump do that would truly alienate a large segment of the electorate at this point now again it may be that all the folus is on biden right now this is the going theory in the democratic party and that when swivel that that spotlight back onto trump in the upcoming year that his poll numbers are going to crater that 's a theory you know maybe it 's true maybe it 's not this poll shows by the way that in a race between joe biden and ron de santis that race looks even or biden plus three if it looks if you look at trump versus harris trump beats harris by 12 points if it were biden versus nikki haley biden is up one on nikki haley again why because niki haley 's numbers are at like 41 % dan sans 's numbers are like 42 % biden is still at 42 or 45 % which were the same numbers he would have against trump except that everybody knows trump and would already move over to the guy they already know so there 's something to the known quantity and these poll numbers are devastating for joe biden they are awful for joe biden every single element of this poll is terrible for joe biden now what what is underlying this there are a few things that are underlying this one thing that 's underlying this obviously is the fact that joe biden has been really bad on policy and on every single policy issue people tend to favor republicans over democrats at this point except for perhaps abortion and this election is not going to be run on abortion if trump is the nominee because nobody perceives trump as particularly pro - life because he 's not campaigning as somebody who 's particularly pro - life he says i got rid a row my job here is done and that 's actually not a a stupid political attitude to take when it comes to federal a of the abortion issue it 's actually something that was sort of tried by len yunin in virginia and for all the talk about how it do not work it kind of did virginia is a very blue state and pretty much everything that was within a biden plus n went republican in virginia because glen yunin took a 15we position on abortion because that 's a very purple state purple to blue well nationally speaking trump is avoiding the abortion issue which means he sort of takes it off the table and then it just becomes a referendum up or down on did you like the country better when trump is running it or did you like the country better when joe biden is running it combine that with the fact that everyone thinks that joe biden is too old and you got a real problem on your hands,0.3541,and we are seeing this from today 's revolutionaries and i am not exaggerating here the goal of many people on the what i have called in my book that disintegration is left the goal of many of those people is to destroy all icons of american history to destroy american history itself and this is why you see in san francisco 's golden gate park the tearing down of a wide variety of statues including statues of people who are deeply instrumental in ending slavery and fighting the the anti reconstruction south so ulysses s grant who is now being sort of in in revisionist fashion thought of is a very very good president originally he was thought of as not a great president because of corruption and venality supposedly during his administration it turns out a lot of that history had been written by people who are sort of sympathetic to the south ulysses s grant is now seeing is not only the general who smashed the confederacy but also the president who helped try to implement reconstruction in a way that preserved the rights of black southerners and the end of his presidency men the end of reconstruction efforts in america for a hundred years it was really a tragedy the end of his presidency the reconstructionist republicans the radical republicans were basically ousted from power about the same time as ulysses s grant ulysses s grant is a great hero of american history we are not talking here about taking down robert e lee 's statues which is controversial in and of itself we are certainly not talking about taking down nathan bedford forrest statues right the founder the kkk talking about taking down the statues of the guy who is the most instrumental general in destroying the slaveholding confederacy and the morons i would say well you know maybe they are not morons because again they have an agenda but the the i would say the the moral fools on the on the radical left have decided that even statues of ulysses s grant have to be taken down according to the hill while grant is widely celebrated as being one of the leading forces who helped the union win the civil war bringing an end to slavery in the united states some historians have pointed to his complicated relationship with slavery because as we know most people did not have a complicated relationship with slavery in 1859 it slavery was not a thing in 1859 protestors in san francisco on friday toppled the statue of former president grant san francisco police said approximately 400 people gathered around 8:00 p.m. to take down the statue and no arrests were made where exactly are the cops during office where is the law in order that we were promised exactly from the white house where exactly does this perpetual revolution end all so torn down in the park the statues of st . junipero serra and francis scott key who wrote the lyrics to the star - spangled banner and people on the left are really hesitant to condemn any of this that i have seen very little upset over the taking down of the statue of junipero serra despite the fact that joe biden was on tape and says nancy pelosi standing in front of a statue of st . junipero serra i believe what the pope a few years back because of course he is a catholic saint the grant statue coming down is really the key right because when you talk about junipero serra you could at least make the case that he treated the the natives badly but even junipero serra he 's really in line with columbus right the idea here is that when what people 's came to the new world that they destroyed the new world on the back of the western imperialism because of course imperialism colonialism and evil never existed until the west arrived in the new world but ok junipero serra who is the founder of the mission system in in california on behalf of the spanish government his stature was taken down they went after a statue of cervantes which does not even make sense restaurantes lee i wrote don quixote cervantes was held as a slave for 5 years then went after his statue anyway because they do not know anything do not know who this guy was they just saw a white guy and so they decided to deface his statue was the basic idea here but the taking town of the statue of grant is so telling because again grant is a figure who stood against slavery grants is a figure whose instrumental in destroying the confederacy grant stands for all the things that the protesters say they stood for at least if you are looking at his public image but he has to be taken down too because all of american history has to be rewritten not as the story of a country struggling to overcome the evils of human nature struggling to overcome its own inability to fulfill its founding principles instead the country has to be rewritten as evil from founding and the only good people who have ever lived make no mistake the only good people who have ever lived are leftists from the radical sixties on everybody else in human history was bad everybody from the nineteen sixties on who was radical was good and even the sixties radicals were not radical enough and they must be thrown out of the universities today they were still a little bit too liberal the radicals from the 1960s because they they used to say things like we want to live a life beyond color in the united states we want to live a life where race does not matter in the united states see even that is inherently racist and so even they are not good the only people who are good are the people who read the 16:19 project and think that it represents all of american history the only people who are good today are the the anti - racists pushed forward by ibrahim candy right those are the only people who are good in the united states today they live right now is not it amazing to live at this time when the only good people live right know good people have ever lived before and if you took those people who are good today and you plop them down in 1850 they would believe exactly the same things they believe today in 1850 dude and out there in the streets stumping for transgender rights and gay marriage and for anti racism of the mold that talks about how if you say that you are colorblind and you are totally in favor of the equality of races then that 's not enough right,0.1555,maybe we do have an issue with police officers every single case that is brought to the public forefront the thing that never gets discussed is why could not this person listen to police orders and i mean we are not talking about like the police snapped on the i am talking the police officer is saying 18 20 30 times giving them an instruction and they do not do it and they keep coming towards the police officer a police officer 's life needs to be protected too um and these people are crazy what we saw in philadelphia with that guy walter wallace wielding a knife i mean and and still black lives matter protested and rioted and looted and because he was shot and killed as he should have been shot and killed because he tried to kill police officers um the problem is that we have arrived suddenly into a society where people do not believe that they have to respect adults period and this is what happens when you have an entire generation of people who have grown up without fathers in the home you know the idea of listening to any type of authority feels to them to be like an assault why should i have to listen to a police officer why should i have listened to my teacher why should i listen to my guidance counselor we have an authority issue in this country in terms of having basic respect and and it 's not a hard request when a police officer pulls you over i have been pulled over i listened to his instructions that 's the first thing right now you have parents teaching people you do not have to listen to police officers instructions if you are black but when we look it 's going to lead to more black death when we look at a lot of these videos we see incidences where police seem to be using excessive force right now the most extreme example is george floyd who lost his life but then there 's other examples where we look at the videos and we go wait a minute what in god 's name is happening why are the cops doing this why are they sitting on a guy why are they cutting off his airway like can not should not cops be trained to basically get someone in cuffs and then put them in a police car and not use a lot of these techniques that they are using whether it 's a chokehold or something where you can do serious damage to somebody would not that be good to kind of do more training i mean more training is not a bad idea right for the police saying when is it when is a cop done a choke hold on somebody without asking them to first abide by basic instructions let us use george floyd as an example because they refused to release the full tape in its entirety until it leaked to daily mail you know some eight months after the riots had stopped right he was asked to get in the vehicle he was already in cops and was asked to get the vehicle he resisted getting in the vehicle as he was standing he was already cuffed said he was claustrophobic and do not want to get in the vehicle and asked to be put on the ground,0.5078,"so if you think i am doing a good job i really really ask you to share this video and explain why you think it was good but let us read from interfax they say kiev october 9th former us vice president joe biden received $ 900,000 for lobbying activities from ber yzma group ukraine 's verkhovna rada member andrey der koch said citing investigation materials now the i am pronouncing it wrong probably but verkhovna rada is ukrainian parliament or i believe it means supreme council der koch publicized documents which as he said describe the mechanism of getting money to money by biden senior at a press conference at interfax ukraine 's press center in kiev on wednesday quote this was the transfer of ber yzma group 's funds for lobbying activities as investigators believe personally to joe biden through a lobbying company funds in the amount of nine hundred thousand dollars were transferred to the us - based company rosemont seneca partners which according to open sources in particular the new york times is a failure with biden notes mostly hunter biden the payment reference was payment for consultative services now let us walk this back a little bit some reporting in the u.s . is not referring to this referring to this as a payment to joe biden but that it was an extensive peut payment of a hundred sixty six thousand dollars per month to hunter biden in this particular instance this politician is saying no it was for joe but let us read on he also publicized sums that were transferred to ber yzma groups representatives in particular hunter biden a son of the former us vice president quote according to the documents verismo paid no less than sixteen point five million to former polish president who became an independent actor at boersma holdings in 2014 alexander was kwasniewski chairman of the verismo board of independent directors allen apter deven archer and hunter biden and these are the devin archer and hunter biden are the individuals depicted in that that photograph now that 's gone viral of joe biden with the two now joe has claimed he has not discussed this company with his son but here he is in a photo with two of its board members many people feel that biden is not being truthful quote using political and economic levelers of influencing ukrainian authorities and manipulating the issue of providing financial aid to ukraine joe budden actively assisted closing criminal cases into the activity of former ukrainian ecology minister mykola zovsky who is the founder and owner of ber is mcgrew p said biden 's fifth visit to kiev on december 7th through 8th 2015 was devoted to making a decision on the resignation of then ukrainian prosecutor general viktor shokan over the case of logic hev ski and ber yzma loan guarantees worth 1 billion dollars the united states was to give to ukraine was the point of pressure biden himself admitted exerting pressure in his speech at the council of foreign relations in january 2018 calling shokan son of a b who is fired the timeline of events proves that the u.s . linked the salahi case to loans lot chef ski case to loan guarantees he said after the decree dismissing shogun was published on april 3rd 2016 the governments of the united states and ukraine signed a loan guarantee agreement worth 1 billion dollars several months later on june 3rd he said now this story is so insanely complicated because right now you have democrats and republicans accusing each other of the exact same thing that trump was withholding aid to ukraine in exchange for political favors while trump accused the democrats namely biden of withholding us aid to ukraine in exchange for political favors now the issue here with trump is there arguing trump is trying to negatively impact joe biden going in 2020 in my personal opinion i do not think trump cares about biden going into 2020 because he has the incumbent advantage his approval rating is up from where vermeer was two years ago and the economy is doing really really well the economy is one of the drug it 's the biggest driving factor in election why would trump need dirt on biden it does not seem to make sense but the left would argue that 's the case now in reference to biden biden according to the accusers would have risked while getting himself in trouble if this money was for him but more importantly his son could end up being prosecuted or called out could be very very damaging for the democrats in the long run so both seem to have something to lose in both investigations so let us let us read a little bit more i do not want to spend too much on this story they say quote in this case there are fact in this case there are facts should be subject to investigation there 's an agency that has powers to investigate them the us department of justice if the ukrainian prosecutor general signs documents and send them to us department of justice without any requests he will accomplish his mission he said adding that the ukrainian prosecutor general has such powers considering international corruption is in public is a way out for president zalinsky i am certain that he is not involved in international corruption well let us stop right here and let us jump over the next story rudy giuliani has evidence that joe biden received $ 900,000 in lobbying fees from hunters from his son 's ukrainian gas company burr yzma and claims father - son duo sold influence and china and romania you have got stories and nbc in the near post saying ukrainian prosecutors say there 's no wrongdoing and nothing going on you have got stories from ukrainian politicians saying no there was something here",0.5644,"meanwhile the intersectional coalition which has the media as its spokesperson the the entire media infrastructure which is dedicated to the proposition that the west is the bad guy in the world and israel is just a spear point for the left that sort of stuff lends a lot of credence and credibility to the worst people in the world which is presumably why according to the wall street journal the situation in the middle east has gotten significantly worse quote the explosion at a gaza hospital tuesday night set off a wave of protests across much of the middle east and the broader muslim world some of them calling for death to israel there 's a shock now it does not matter by the way that the palestinians killed their own people here and then lied about it does not matter at all by the way i i love that that people are still repeating the casual casual statistics brought to them by the hamas health ministry a literal lying terrorist organization tells you how many people are dead and injured and they have a magical ability by the way to count this stuff in minutes israel is still figuring out exactly how many people were murdered from the october 7th attacks which is like two weeks ago but kamas within minutes can tell you exactly to the person how many people were killed their ages and who they were or they are lying to you and the media are credulous morons or they are not just credulous morons they actually are quasi pramas in any case all of this has now exploded in the middle east anger nevertheless spread quickly through the region according to the wall street journal riots broke out near the israeli embassy in jordan where millions of palestinian diaspora live and which has had diplomatic ties with israel since the 1990s by the way when they say the palestinian diaspora understand that 's not correct trans jordan was part of british mandate palestine trans jordan is filled with palestinian arrows because british mandate palestine included jordan around 880,000 turkish protesters descended on the israeli consulates in istanbul some attacking security forces and attempting to enter the compound according to authorities again not a shock there turkey has been a longtime ally of kamas they famously attempted to send a flotilla of weaponry into israel which ended with israel having to raid the flotilla and that of course was then blamed on israel in iran thousands of people across several cities demonstrated including at the french and british embassies that of course is ginned up by the iranian government a lot of iranians are not anti - israel there of weird irony in the middle east which is that in places where the government is the most anti - israel the population tends to be the most kind of apathetic or okay with israel that would be like iran and in places where the government is least anti - israel which would be like saudi arabia the population hates israel it 's kind of it 's kind of interesting there are chance from protesters in iraq iran on tuesday night calling for the death of israel some governments like turkey and jordan have declared days of mourning like the governments themselves looking for an off - ramp so they can please their domestic constituency they declared a day of mourning on behalf of a hospital massacre that did not happen number one and number two was caused by palestinian islamic jihad if it did so all of this is propagandistic and the media did its best to promote all of that meanwhile cnn is is having fun they are doing their mostly peaceful protest thing again fiery but mostly peaceful in am on jordan and we saw yesterday hundreds of people gathering some protesters even attempting to sto storm the israeli embassy so we have seen a bit of an increase in the security presence here although it has been mostly uh peaceful mostly pe i mean sure they are trying to you know break into mses but it 's mostly peaceful as we all know this is the way that it works just like the black lives matter riots which cost $ 2 billion in property damage fiery but mostly peaceful is what 's happening over there meanwhile jordan 's foreign minister iman safadi said on wednesday that they do not care whether islamic jihad bombed a hospital they do not care about that at all instead actually there 's deep skepticism quote nobody is buying that narrative in this part of the world everyone here believes that israel is responsible for it the israeli army is saying it 's not but to be honest try and fight anyone who 's going to believe it in this part of the world i wonder why that is could that be because you have had generations of uh of lies teaching that jews are the scum of the earth and they ought to be exterminated maybe it 's that maybe it 's because of that meanwhile all these arab nations which care so deeply about the palestinians in gaza they care so deeply about them uh we are up to 21 muslim nations that have expressed solidarity with the palestinians in gaza a a grand total of zero have offered any any refugee assistants any in fact egypt 's foreign minister came out yesterday and said absolutely not we are we are not going to take any refugees said there 's pressure on egypt and other countries in the region to absorb refugees from gaza egypt refuses on principle ah the principle is that you have to keep people in a war zone that 's the principle that 's a hell of an amazing principle that you have found there or maybe you do not want the palestinian refugees in egypt because you are afraid they are going to destabilize your regime as they have routinely destabilized regimes ranging from jordan to lebanon again lebanon is a case in point of what happens when palestinian refugees and their leadership on mass enter a country lebanon used to be a fully functioning christian country beut was known as the paris of the middle east it is now a trash heap that would be the reason why egypt does not want to let in palestinian refugees from the gaza strip that 's the exact reon so instead they are just going to keep them in a war zone and encourage them to stand directly over terror tunnels to shield the terrorists meanwhile it 's it 's amazing i love this nations in the middle east are apparently urging their citizens to evacuate lebanon multiple countries have alerted their citizens inside lebanon they should immediately evacuate asbah ramps up its attacks on israel 's northern borders reuters has reported that heah official hashem safin gave a speech to thousands of supporter on wednesday claiming the terrorist group was thousands of times stronger than it was in the past threatening israel and the west meanwhile tons of nations including by the way kuwait and saudi arabia are urging people to leave lebanon asap",0.9451,we are starting today 's video with two questions do you think that men are likely to be sexist against women in the hiring process that in some circumstances a man will not hire a woman because she is a woman comment below let me know what you think the next question do you think that a computer algorithm would do a better job of hiring people equally meaning that there would be less discrimination and more women and minorities would be hired comment below let me think we have got a story now that amazon was secretly running an artificial intelligence in their recruiting process the idea was a machine will do a better job of finding the best candidate and it will not discriminate based on gender or race however it ultimately did start discriminating because there are key factors and key differences between men and women that the algorithm actually found amazon had to suspend this practice and there 's other data to suggest that even though we do not have an equality of outcome meaning that in many jobs we do not see 52 women and 48 men we do see that men actually favor women in the hiring process and when we go gender blind in recruitment it actually penalizes women so perhaps it 's not so much about sexism more so that men and women make different choices but let us let us explore this a little bit first we will start with the story about amazon now before we get started please head over to patreon.comcast to help support my work patrons are the backbone of the content i create so if you like these videos and you like the videos on my second channel please go to patreon.comcast and become a patron today from venturebeat amazon scrapped a secret ai recruitment tool that showed bias against women amazon.com 's machine learning specialist uncovered a big problem their new recruiting engine did not like women the team had been building computer programs since 2014 to review job applicants resumes with the aim of mechanizing the search for top talent five people familiar with the effort told reuters the company 's experimental hiring tool used artificial intelligence to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars much like shoppers rate products on amazon some of the people said everyone wanted this holy grail they literally wanted it to be an engine where i am going to give you 100 resumes it will spit out the top five and we will hire those but by 2015 the company realized the new system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender - neutral way that is because amazon 's computer models were trained to vet applicants by observing patterns and resumes submitted to the company over a 10 - year period most came from men a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry in effect amazon 's system taught itself that male candidates were preferable it penalized resumes that included the word women 's as in women 's chess captain and it downgraded graduates of two all - women 's colleges according to people familiar with the matter amazon edited the program to make them neutral to these particular terms but that was no guarantee that the machines would not devise other ways of sorting candidates that could prove discriminatory that people said the seattle company ultimately disbanded the team by the start of last year because executives lost hope for the project amazon 's recruiters looked at the recommendations generated by the tool when searching for new hires but never relied solely on those rankings they said the story mentions how some 55 of us human resource manager said artificial intelligence would be a regular part of their work within the next five years and this is according to a 2017 survey by talent software firm career builder if someone said to me that they thought a computer program was going to do a good job of removing discrimination and bringing about equality of outcome i would say you are wrong and it 's very obvious the computer program will do the opposite there are people who went to fancy prestigious schools and they had access to money somebody who goes to harvard for instance is probably more likely to have money in their family which means they are more likely to have extracurricular activities which means they are more likely to have accolades and their resume is going to look better they are also going to have more access to resources and their parents who are going to be highly educated are probably going to help them craft a better resume so you will have poor people whose resumes do not look that good who went to less prestigious schools who will get weighed down then you are going to have women who might have gaps in their employment history from taking care of their family and the machine is going to say well this person was not working and this person was so it 's ultimately going to favor those who are more likely to be wealthy and less likely to be female it 's rather obvious now a lot of people say maybe we just need humans to do it but we remove the names so they can not tell if it 's a woman or a man and they can not tell if the person 's white or non - white in fact that actually does not work either blind recruitment trial to boost gender equality making things worse study reveals leaders of the australian public service will today be told to hit pause on blind recruitment trials which many believed would increase the number of women in senior positions blind recruitment means recruiters can not tell the gender of candidates because those details are removed from applications it is seen as an alternative to gender quotas and has also been embraced by deloitte ernst young victoria police and westpac bank in a bid to eliminate sexism thousands of public servants have been told to pick recruits who have had all mentions of their gender and ethnic background stripped from their cvs the assumption behind the trial is that management will hire more women when they can only consider the professional merits of candidates their choices have been monitored by behavioral economists in the prime minister 's department colloquially known as the nudge unit professor michael hiscox a harvard academic who oversaw the trial said he was shocked by the results and has urged caution we anticipated this would have a positive impact on diversity making it more likely that female candidates and those from ethnic minorities are selected for the short list we found the opposite that de - identifying candidates reduced the likelihood of women being selected for the shortlist the trial found assigning a male name to a candidate made them 3.2 percent less likely to get a job interview adding a woman 's name to a cv made the candidate 2.9 more likely to get a foot in the door we should hit pause and be very cautious about introducing this as a way of improving diversity as it can have the opposite effect hiscox said at least according to this study done in australia it would seem that in the hiring process men actually give the benefit to women perhaps the reason that we do not see equal outcome in these jobs is because women just choose to do different things maybe not that many women are actually applying for these jobs,0.3116,okay the biden plan which is different than what he calls the radical green new deal all right gentlemen final segment election integrity as we meet tonight millions of americans are receiving mail - in ballots or going to vote early how confident should we be that this will be a fair election and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks because it will not only be to election day

in this final segment mr vice president you go first prepared to let people vote they should go to iwillvote.com decide how they are going to vote when they are going to vote and what means by which they are going to vote his own homeland security director as well as the fbi director says there is no evidence at all that mail - in ballots are a source of of being manipulated and cheating they said that the fact is that they are going to be millions of people because of covet that are going to be voting by mail - in ballots like he does by the way he sits behind the resolute desk and sends his ballot to florida number one number two we are going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance the polls are open on time and their polls stay open until the votes are counted and this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he 's trying to con to scare

what he 's going to accept,0.2967,but it was solzhenitsyn who truly shamed the radical leftists forcing them underground where they have festered and plotted for the last forty years failing unforgivably to have learned what all reasonable people should have learned from the cataclysm of the 20th century and its egalitarian utopianism and day despite everything and under their sway almost three decades since the fall of the berlin wall and the apparent collapse of communism we are doing everything we can to forget what solzhenitsyn so clearly demonstrated to our great and richly deserved peril why do not all our children read the gulag archipelago in our high schools as they now do in russia why do not our teachers feel compelled to read the book aloud did we not win the cold war where the body 's not piled high enough how high then would be enough why for example is it still acceptable and in polite company to profess the philosophy of a communist or if not that to at least admire the work of marx why is it still acceptable to regard the marxist doctrine as essentially accurate in its diagnosis of the hypothetical evils of the free - market democratic west to still consider that doctrine progressive and fit for the compassionate and proper thinking person 25 million dead through internal repression in the soviet union according to the black book of communism 60 million dead in mao 's china and an all too likely returned to autocratic oppression in that country in the near future the horrors of cambodia 's killing fields with their two million corpses the barely animate body politic of cuba where people struggle even now to feed themselves venezuela where it has now been made illegal to attribute a child 's death in hospital to starvation no political experiment has ever been tried so widely with so many disparate people in so many different countries with such different histories and failed so absolutely and catastrophic lee is it mere ignorant al biet of the most inexcusable kind that allows today 's marxist to flaunt their content allegiance to present it as compassion and care or is it instead envy of this successful in near infinite proportions or something akin to hatred for mankind itself how much proof do we need why do we still avert our eyes from the truth perhaps we simply lack sophistication perhaps we just can not understand perhaps our tendency toward compassion is so powerfully necessary in the intimacy of our families and friendships that we can not contemplate its limitations it 's an ability to scale and it 's propensity to mutate into hatred of the oppressor rather than allegiance with the oppressed perhaps we can not comprehend the limitations and dangers of the utopian vision given our definite need to contemplate and to strive for a better tomorrow we certainly do not seem to imagine for example that the hypothesis of some state of future perfection for example the truly egalitarian and permanent brotherhood of man can be used to justify any and all sacrifices whatsoever the pristine and heavenly and making all conceivable means not only acceptable but morally required there is simply no price too great to pay in pursuit of the ultimate utopia and this is particularly true if it is someone else who foots the bill and it is clearly the case that we require a future toward which to orient ourselves to provide meaning in our life psychologically speaking it is for that reason we see the same need expressed collectively on a much larger scale in the judeo - christian vision of the promised land and the kingdom of heaven on earth and it is also clearly the case that sacrifice is necessary to bring that desired end state into being that 's the discovery of the future itself the necessity to forgo instantaneous gratification in the present to delay to bargain with fate so that the future can be better twinned with the necessity to let go to burn off to separate wheat from chaff and to sacrifice what is presently unworthy so that tomorrow can be better than today but limits need to be placed around who or what is deemed dispensable and it is exactly the necessity for interminable sacrifice that constitutes the counterpart of the utopian vision heaven is worth any price but who pays christianity solved that problem by insisting on the sacrifice of the self insisting that the suffering and malevolence of the world is the responsibility of each individual insisting that each of us sacrifice what is unworthy and unnecessary and resentful and deadly in our characters despite the pain of such sacrifice so that we could stumble properly uphill under our respective and voluntarily shouldered existential burdens but it was and is the opinion of the materialist utopians that someone else be sacrificed so that heaven itself might be attained some perpetrator or victimizer or oppressor or member of a privileged group a cynic might be forgiven in consequence for asking is it the city of god that is in fact the aim or is the true aim the desire to make a burning sacrificial pyre of everyone and everything and the hypothesis of the coming brotherhood of man merely the cover story the camouflage perhaps it is precisely the horror that is the point and not the utopia it is far from obvious in such situations just what is horse and what is cart it is precisely in the aftermath of the death of a hundred million people or more that such dark questions must be asked and we should also note that the utopian vision dressed as it is inevitably in compassion is a temptation particularly difficult to resist and may therefore offer a particularly subtle and insidious justification for mayhem here are some thoughts know some facts every social system produces inequality at present and every social system has done so since the beginning of time the poor have been with us and will be with us always analysis of the content of individual paleolithic grave sites provides evidence for the existence of variance in the distribution of ability privilege and wealth even in our distant past the more illustrious of our ancestors were buried with great possessions hoards of precious metals weaponry jewelry and costuming the majority however struggled through their lives and were buried with nothing inequality is the iron rule even among animals with their intense competition for quality living space and repre ducked ivana hmong plants and cities even among the stellar lights that dot the cosmos themselves where a minority of privileged and oppressive heavenly bodies contain the mass of thousands millions or even billions of average dispossessed planets inequality is the deepest of problems built into the structure of reality itself and will not be solved by the presumptuous ideology inspired retooling of the rare free stable and productive democracies of the world the only systems that have produced some modicum of wealth along with the inevitable inequality and it 's in tendency along with the inevitable inequality and its attendant suffering the only systems that have produced some modicum of wealth along with the inevitable inequality and its attendant suffering are those that evolved in the west with their roots in the judeo - christian tradition precisely those systems that emphasized above all the essential dignity divinity and ultimate responsibility of the individual in consequence any attempt to attribute the existence of inequality to the functioning of the productive institutions we have managed to create and protect so recently in what is still accurately regarded as the free world will hurt those who are weakest and most vulnerable first the radicals who conflate the activities of the west with the oppression of the downtrodden therefore do nothing to aid those whom they purport to prize and plenty to harm them the claims they make to act under the inspiration of pure compassion must therefore come to be regarded with the deepest suspicion not least by those who dare to make such claims themselves the dangers of the utopian vision have been laid bare even if the reasons those dangers exist have not yet been fully unacceptably articulated if there was any excuse to be a marxist in 1917 and both dostoyevsky and nietzsche prophesied well before then that there would be hell to pay for that doctrine there is absolutely and finally no excuse now,0.2102,1st peter 3:21 says that the lights figure like he did in those days he 's going to cleanse you of your sins by will water not wiping off the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience towards god your obedience is going to the water is going to save you in your obedience like it 's saved noah and his family by way of obedience they obey god and he granted them salvation you obey god he will grant you salvation nor they get into the water god cleansed the world with the water noah was saved god used the water as a cleansing mechanism noah and his family were right with god the other people were not that 's why god only saved noah his family everybody else were not right with god he used them to cleanse that work the earth almost the symbolism of cleaning away sin but see some people are too caught up in religion they do not get it cleansing the earth of sin so that no american can reside on the earth they were the only ones they were without sin god wants to cleanse you of your sins by your obedience by way of the water do not believe me and when he come back then you will have to talk to him about that all you got to do is read the bible somebody said everybody making assumptions cornelius house receiving the holy spirit was about showing the gentiles were part of the plan it 's it 's not just showing since half of the part of the plan the promise of the holy spirit is to everybody as many as the lord our god chef karl so the gentiles can get it you can get it your mama can get it your cousin can get it is to everybody and your god used that as an example but what does that have to do with people speaking in tongues come on man you all got to stop listening to these fake pastors man i am telling you let us see john thank so much with super check the bible way to heaven preacher pastor stephen anders search the title onto youtube and savior soul it 's only seven minutes faith in christ saves not works lynn i am going to tell you why that 's not true you do not work for a gift and the gift is it is eternal life let me tell you why that 's not true thank you for the super check let me change let me let me tell you why people get confused they tell me this not in the bible faith without works is dead faith without works is dead so i need to get the bible let me get the scripture out for you all because you do not believe me faith without works is dead i am going to give you the faith the scripture because people like that they like to say faith without works is dead and then when it applies to them they want to leave that out of the bible i am going to tell you what the bible say today james 2:14 through 26 james - i am just going to read the bible man do not do not believe do not you people trying to translate and try to tell you just read the book for yourself people going to get you all caught up to 14,0.396,"but i was going to vote democrat anyway he led among people whose top issue was income inequality and among people who never attend a religious service which is not people in the midwest generally religious observance is much higher in the midwest than it is on the coasts he won with men but that is trump stronghold he is not going to breakthrough with trump and men he is not trump just has a massive gender gap trump is much more popular with men generally than bernie sanders he did well with union households but as it comes out that bernie sanders wants to get rid of the cadillac plans a negotiated by many unions as tim ryan points out right there then a lot of unions are going to turn against them as well see they are already doing this in nevada and needs it well with people whose income was less than $ 50,000 which sounds great except for the fact that that also happens to be a voter group that tends to turn out less than its general percentage of the population so in other words bernie did really well among the groups that are a shrinking share of the american electorate right he did really well among the groups that do not show up to vote which is a disaster for democrats now you look at amy klobuchar right who 's the person if democrats were smart they would mobilize behind amy klobuchar i have been saying this for at least a week i have actually been saying this for long in them and saying for several months that it 's bewildered to me why amy klobuchar does not have a higher level of support she did really well last night amy klobuchar scored about 20 % in new hampshire blowing out both joe biden and elizabeth warren look at her crowd among people who attend religious services weekly she won by 12 those are the people that the democrats need to win they need to not alienate the religious voters who still represent a majority of voters in this country now the democrats have a bit of a conflict which is that the plurality and maybe majority of voters in the democratic electorate are of no religious affiliation are not religious but in the country the country is so overall a religious country amy klobuchar one those voters right that 's a big share that you need to win and she won among voters who are age 65 and older who are the people who she needs to cut into if she hopes to sing trump those are the people that bernie did worst with so this is the p buddha judge by the way one with people whose top issue was climate change which by a pew poll yesterday is the second to last issue that americans care about that means that if democrats were smart they would mobilize behind amy klobuchar but the problem is of course that the democratic middle lane has been clogged up by biden and that was the other big story last night so there 's a question as to where the big story was bernie winning which again sort of foreseen or whether it was bernie underperforming which i tend to think was a bigger story because it does mean that this is still a competitive primary season we have only don two states at this point we have not hit super tuesday yet as we will see michael bloomberg is ramping up the spending he continues to spend literally hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising in states that have not been pulled yet we have no idea how that is charting but the really big story last night is that joe biden continues to just collapse i mean joe biden last night did not only leave the state of new hampshire early for seeing loss there he do not even travel to nevada now i have been saying for a while if he loses in iowa new hampshire and nevada he 's toast because there 's no way to recover from that and win south carolina and then start sweeping on super tuesday and you have been seeing his poll numbers in south carolina collapse it 's not as though his poll numbers in south carolina are bulletproof they absolutely are not the latest polling data from south carolina is not beneficial to to joe biden particularly the the post courier for example did a poll at the end of january and it showed that biden was only up 25 2004 bernie sanders of tom styer who 's been spending a fortune in south carolina scoring at 18 percent of the vote in south carolina now stires going to stay in until south carolina there was some talk maybe he will drop out he 's not going to he spent all of his money in south carolina why exactly what he dropped out in new hampshire there 's one good poll that has come out in the last few days about a week and a half ago actually from east carolina university but that came out again before the iowa caucuses and that showed biden up 37 to 19 over style with sanders all the way down at 14",0.5702,and then you could see buzzfeed got a willian what was the dossier that he was briefed on here it is p tape it basically was an excuse set up by comey and other members of the fbi in order to create a rationale for buzzfeed to run the dossier in the first place now again there are a few links in that chain that have yet to be substantiated communications for example between comey or members of the fbi and members of the press right now that has yet to be substantiated but this has always been a weird outstanding question why exactly would comey brief trump on the dossier that was unsubstantiated and had no impact on the actual investigation according to democrats right the steel dossier supposedly was not the basis really for fisa warrants or for the opening of the investigation in the first place because if it were then it would look kind of nefarious that hillary clinton 's campaign created the dossier with christopher steele then handed it over to barack obama 's fbi which initiated an investigation against her political opponents in the 2016 campaign right that starts to look an awful lot like a conspiracy between the obama doj and fbi and the hillary clinton campaign and starts to look really really bad so there are a lot of open questions here homies meeting with trump took place one day after the fbi director met in the oval office with president obama and vice president joe biden to discuss how to brief trump a meeting attended by the nsa susan rice homeland security secretary jeh johnson deputy attorney general sally yates and national intelligence director james clapper who would soon go work for cnn comey denied having an accounts or intelligence case file open on trump though he qualified the denial by adding this was true only in the literal sense he also twice tonight investigating trump under oath in congressional testimony so depending on what horowitz finds there could be a perjury charge here former federal prosecutor andrew mccarthy who 's written extensively on all of this said that just because the president 's name was not put on a file or a surveillance warrant does not mean that the comey fbi was not investigating him they were hoping to surveil him incidentally and they were trying to make a case on him said mccarthy the real reason comey did not want to repeat publicly the assurance he made to trump privately is that the assurance was misleading the fbi strung trump along telling him he was not a subject while structuring the investigation in accordance with the reality that trump was actually the main suspect this of course is disputed by other folks former fbi counterintelligence agent and lawyer marc walk said that the fbi lacked legal grounds to treat trump as a suspect a no probable cause they were scrambling to come up with anything to hang a hat on but they 'd found nothing so it 's unclear why exactly this investigation became such a a massive massive thing given the slim read upon which it was originally based apparently and that remains the subject of michael horowitz his investigation so commis conduct is clearly going to come up for all sorts of controversy according to paul sperry over real clear investigations at the time comey was personally scrutinizing the president during meetings in the white house and phone conversations from the fbi he had an agent inside the white house working on the russia investigation he reported back to fbi headquarters about trump and his aides the agent was named anthony ferrante he specialized in cybercrime he left the white house had around the same time comey was fired and soon joined a security consulting firm where he contracted with buzzfeed to lead the news sites efforts to verify the seal dossier in connection with a defamation lawsuit knowledgeable sources inside the trump white house say that kovac armed comey carved out an extraordinary new position for ferrante which allowed for him to remain on reserve status at the fbi while working in the white house as a cyber security adviser so i think this report was supposed to drop july so we should find out in very short order what exactly michael horowitz has to say about the initiation of the russia investigation which of course is the other side of the coin in terms of the muller investigation why did this thing start why was so many resources placed into it was it nefariously begun with an attempt to get president trump because he was hillary clinton 's chief antagonist and opponent in 2016 so we will bring you all of the developments there as this continues all righty so we will be back here a little bit later today we will have two additional hours of programming and if you do not get that then go to daily wire.com subscribing get that every single day,0.2762,you think i am making light of his his concurrence it 's because i am because it 's really really stupid and terrible at the time of road 30 states still prohibited abortion at all stages in the years prior to that decision about a third of the states had liberalized their laws but abruptly ended that political process it imposed the same highly restrictive regime on the entire nation it effectively struck down abortion laws in every single state as just as byron white aptly put it in his descent the exercise the decision represented the exercise of raw judicial power it sparked a national controversy that has embedded our political culture for half a century the court continues eventually in planned parenthood versus casey the court revisited roe but the members of the court split three ways two justices expressed no desire to change her own anyway four others wanted to overrule the decision in its entirety the remaining three justices who jointly signed the controlling opinion took a third position their opinion did not endorse roe 's reasoning it even hinted that one or more of its authors might have reservations about whether the constitution protects a right to abortion but the opinion concluded that starry decisis which calls for prior decisions to be followed in most instances required adherence to what it called rose central holding that a state may not constitutionally protect fetal life before a viability even if that holding was wrong anything less the opinion claimed would undermine respect for this court and the rule of law now as we will see that sort of logic is going to rear its ugly head in chief justice roberts 's concurrence which is really i think hideous evidence of what a bad justice he is i was one of the few conservatives to oppose his nomination and his confirmation when it happened under george w bush i think for good reason paradoxically the judgment in case he says the opinions had a fair amount of overruling several important decisions were overruled in toto row itself was overruled in part casey threw out wrote trimester scheme and substituted a new rule of uncertain origin under which states were forbidden to adopt any regulation that imposed a quote - unquote undue burden on a woman 's right to have an abortion the decision provided no clear guidance about the difference between a do and an undue burden but the three justices who contr who authored the controlling opinion called the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by treating the court 's decision as a final settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion as has become increasingly apparent casey did not achieve that goal americans continue to hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion state legislatures have acted accordingly some have recently enacted laws allowing abortion with few restrictions at all stages of pregnancy others have tightly restricted abortion beginning well before viability in this case 26 states have expressly asked this court to overrule roe and casey and allow the states to regulate or prohibit pre - viability abortions the forest is now one state such state law,0.6586,and he says what if putin actually is not miscalculating here here 's what he has to say and if this is the case then this is a big win for putin here 's what he says quote several analysts have compared putin to a cornered rat more dangerous now that he 's no longer in control of events they want to give him a safe way out of the predicament he allegedly created for himself hence the almost universal scorn poured on joe biden for saying in poland for god 's sake this man can not remain in power the conventional wisdom is entirely plausible it has the benefit of vindicating the west 's strategy of supporting ukraine defensively and it tends toward the conclusion that the best outcome is one in which putin finds some face - saving exit additional ukrainian territory ukrainian pledge of neutrality a lifting of some sanctions but what if the conventional wisdom is wrong what if the west is only playing into putin 's hands again the possibility is suggested in a powerful reminisce from the times as carlotta gaul of her experience covering russia 's siege of grajani during the first chechen war in the mid 90s says brett stevens in the early phases of the war motivated chechen fighters wiped out a russian armored brigade stunning moscow the russians regrouped and wiped out garage from afar using artillery and air power russia is operating from the same playbook today when western military analysts argue that putin can not win militarily in ukraine what they really mean is he can not win clean since when is putin never played clean gaul writes there 's a whole next stage to the putin playbook which is well known to the chechens as russia as russian troops gained control on the ground in chechnya they crushed any further descent with arrests and filtration camps and by turning and empowering local proteges and collaborators so brett stephen says suppose for a moment putin never intended to conquer all of ukraine that from the beginning his real targets were the energy riches of ukraine 's east which contain europe 's second largest known reserves of natural gas after norway combine that with russia 's previous territorial territorial seizures in crimea which has huge offshore energy fields and the eastern provinces of luhansk and donetsk which contain part of an enormous shale gas field as well as putin 's bid to control most or all of ukraine 's coastline and the shape of putin 's ambitions become clear he 's less interested in reuniting the russian - speaking world than he is in securing russia 's energy dominance canadian energy expert david knight leg says under the guise of an invasion putin is executing an enormous heist as for what 's left of a mostly landlocked ukraine it will likely become a welfare case for the west which will help pick up the tab for resettling ukraine 's refugees to new homes outside of russian control in time a victor orban - like figure could take ukraine 's presidency imitating the strongman style of politics putin prepares in his neighbors if this analysis is right putin does not seem like the miscalculating losers his critics make him out to be it also makes sense of his strategy of targeting civilians more than simply a way of compensating for the incompetence of russia 's troops the mass killing of civilians puts immense pressure on zolensky to agree to the very things putin has demanded all along territorial concessions and ukrainian neutrality within russia the war has already served to putin 's political purposes many in the professional middle class have gone into self - imposed exile the remnants of a free press have been shuttered probably for good to the extent that russia 's military has embarrassed itself says brett stephens is more likely to lead to a well - aimed purge from above than a broad revolution from below so maybe that 's,0.5609,"and that means that her popularity is already baked into the cake at this point furthermore she has because of the halo effect become more popular on the issues even though she is really bad on the issues so because of all the glowing media coverage of kamla harris as a human because of all the focus on kla harris and her dancing and her joy and her cooking and she makes brisket and all a sudden crap because of all the focus on that sort of stuff there 's been a bit of a halo effect that has attached to policies that are exactly the same as joe biden so for example brand new polling from usa today suffk shows that on the economy donald trump is favored over comm harris by just 6 percentage points 51 to 45 he had a 14 - point advantage on joe biden in june on immigration trump is only up three points as opposed to the 13 he was up over joe biden on national security on dealing with china trump was preferred over harris by four but that is down from 10 points in terms of the margin over joe biden now there are two ways to possibly explain that one is that people were so just unsatisfied with joe biden as a human being that they were allowing that to color their perceptions of his policy the other thing that could be happening here is that it turns out joe biden 's policies are garbage that they are really really bad and that kla harris has escaped so far any blame for his policies because she 's not joe biden but that is the job of the trump campaign to tie kla harris to those policies it is that latter supposition that i think is true i think that kamla harris on policy is a disaster show i think that kla harris is a dumpster fire on policy and that when americans realize that she is just a fresh cod of pains on the same batt old policies they do not like from joe biden they are going to be deeply unhappy they are going to be deeply unhappy just as deeply unhappy as they were with joe biden maybe even more so because they will be disappointed that kla harris is more of the same well it 's very weird to be unhappy with joe biden 's policies but somehow happy with kl harris that does not make any sense you

today to get started,0.6131,it 's it to give you a cu a comparison here a normal kind of within the realm of possibility p e ratio for a publicly traded stock is like 22 25 which means that twitter is probably overvalued by a factor of eight and it 's it 's insane that musk was willing to pay 44 billion dollars for the thing in the first place but here was the thing it was sort of a no risk proposition for him because now twitter is over a barrel if musk pulls out of the deal twitter is going to collapse almost entirely and if he does not pull out of the deal he 's going to get a better price so here is the latest exclusive from the washington post quote elon musk 's deal to buy twitter is in serious jeopardy three people familiar with the matter say as musk 's camp concluded that twitter 's figures on spam accounts are not verifiable musk 's team has stopped engaging in certain discussions around funding for the 44 billion deal including with a party named as a likely backer the people spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the ongoing discussions talks with investors have cooled in recent weeks as musk 's camp has raised doubts about the recent data fire hose a trove of data sold to corporate customers they received from twitter musk 's team that doubts about the spam figure signaled they believe that they do not have enough information to evaluate twitter 's prospects as a business now that musk 's team has concluded it can not verify twitter 's figures on spam accounts it is expected to take potentially drastic action the person said it was likely a change in direction for musk 's team would come soon they do not say exactly what they thought that change was going to be the spam accounts are not the only reason musk tri might try to wriggle out of the deal according to the post twitter 's share price has fallen dramatically since his takeover bid in april leading to the impression he 's overpaying yes also musk runs two other major companies tesla and spacex along with some startups the terms of the deal mean it would not be easy for musk to walk away musk has agreed to complete it unless something major happens to twitter 's business legal experts doubt the bot issue would qualify twitter would be a weaker company if the deal falls apart than what musk first bought a stake and experts expect twitter to fight to get it done twitter itself has said it intends to complete the deal if musk convinces a judge to let him walk away he could still be on the hook for a billion dollars in breakup fees twitter spokesperson brian polyakov declined to comment referred to a statement the company made in june twitter said in june that they were going to try and cram through the deal musk is not responding to a request for comment so it looks right now like a shakedown a little bit it looks like musk is just trying to get twitter to drop its price because after all the the price is not even mildly reflective of the actual value of twitter the debate over bots on twitter is not new it 's been a big part of the public conversation around the company for years musk frequently tweets his annoyance at the proliferation of spam and bot accounts on the site writing in april he aims to defeat the spam bots or die trying through his twitter bid outside researchers have sometimes said the number of bots and spam accounts could be much higher than twitter 's estimate but because of how quickly the tactics for creating and concealing the nature of fake accounts change it 's tough for even experts to make strong pronouncements about who exactly is right twitter does not ban all of the bots instead it looks for indicators that suggest fake or coordinated spam activity musk 's taker has plunged twitter into chaos creating rifts between employees and unnies for executives and it is no coincidence that according to the wall street journal twitter is now laying off one third of their recruiting team they announced on thursday they let off 30 of their talent acquisition team the layoffs came after the company announced in may it would be pausing hiring and looking to cut costs as a result of the revised business needs the company is restructuring and reducing its talent acquisition team the layoffs are expected to affect fewer than 100 people they are limited to the talent acquisition team in light of the hiring pause twitter is re - prioritizing that talent acquisition team that includes recruiters to ensure it operates efficiently and responsibly according to the spokesperson thursday twitter officials doubled down on defending the accuracy of their calculation of spam on the platform they say the spam accounts make up less than five percent of the company 's daily monetizable users musk says he thinks it 's closer to 20 percent one person affected by the layoffs said employees who were laid off woke up on thursday to 30 minute meetings put onto their calendars although the layoffs were abrupt they were not completely surprising because twitter announced a hiring phrase so why exactly would they have recruiters the bottom line is that twitter has been in a state of disarray since musk basically threw his bid stripped the veneer that twitter is a successful company twitter is not a successful company the vast majority of people who engage on twitter in a serious way are the blue checks that represents a tiny minority of the people who actually are supposedly users on twitter 's site it 's unclear exactly how twitter makes any money at all their earnings are as i say wildly out of proportion to the price of their stock and to their market cap again if you take that 22.9 billion market cap and you divide that by 160 you are talking about an annual revenue stream of like 143 million dollars that is that 's insane,0.1676,"but i do not care have had a slower response because of the lies and china now has been caught or at least in the past smuggling viruses or i should not say that but perhaps illicit lee transporting them there is a fear of a real potential of war because china is exploiting this crisis sending faulty goods to european countries do not work they are they are lying to us to hurt us for personal economic gain at a certain point they will cross the red line and that 's what 's truly scary let us get started with the first story the report what 's going on why is china lying and what 's really happening before we get started head over to tim cast comm slash done it if you 'd like to support my work that several ways you can give but the best thing you can do share this video it is important people realize the extent to which we are being misled is important that people take this threat seriously in fact many people probably do not think it 's very serious because the death toll globally is low add forty to fifty thousand on top of that and it nearly doubles then maybe people might start listening to how serious this actually is bloomberg reports china concealed extent of virus outbreak us intelligence says china has concealed the extent of the vibe of the corona virus outbreak in its country under reporting both total cases and deaths it suffered from the disease the us intelligence community concluded in a classified report to the white house according to three us officials the officials asked not to be identified because the report is secret and declined to detail its contents but the thrust they said is that china 's public reporting on cases and deaths is intentionally incomplete two of the officials said the report concludes that china 's numbers are fake the report was received for the white house last week one of the officials said the outbreak began in china 's hubei province in late 2019 but the country has publicly reported only about 82,000 cases and 3,300 deaths according to data compiled by johns hopkins university that compares to more than one hundred and eighty - nine thousand and more than 4,000 deaths in the us which has the largest publicly reported outbreak in the world communications staff of the white house and chinese embassy in washington washington do not immediately respond to requests for comment while china eventually imposed a strict lockdown beyond those of less autocratic nations there have been considerable skepticism there has been considerable skepticism of china 's reported numbers both outside and within the country the chinese government has repeatedly revised its methodology for counting cases for weeks excluding people without symptoms entirely and only on tuesday added more than 1,500 asymptomatic cases to its total stacks thousands of urns outside funeral homes in hubei province have driven public doubt in beijing 's reporting deborah birx the state department immunology immunologist advising the white house on its response to the outbreak said tuesday that china 's public reporting influenced assumptions elsewhere in the world about the nature of the virus the medical community made it interpreted that interpreted the chinese data as this was serious but smaller than anyone expected she said at a news conference on tuesday because i think probably we were missing a significant amount of the data now that what we see happened to italy and see what happened to spain china is not the only country with suspect public reporting western officials have pointed to iran russia indonesia and especially north korea which has not reported a single case the disease as probable under counts others including saudi arabia and egypt may also be downplaying their numbers us secretary of state mike pompeo has publicly urged china and other nations to be transparent about their outbreaks he has repeatedly accused china of covering up the extent of the problem and being slow to share information especially in the weeks after the virus first emerged and blocking offers to help american expats i am sorry and blocking offers of help from american expects this data set matters he said at a news conference in washington on tuesday the development of medical therapies and public health measures to commit the virus so that we can save lives depends on the ability to have confidence and information about what is actually transpired i would urge every nation do your best to collect the data do your best to share that information he said we are doing that shockingly many people in media are taking the chinese numbers at face value they are blaming trump they are mocking him saying america has done a worse job why would you entertain chinese propaganda it is particularly scary to me when you when you combine this information with with a few other reports notably that over the past several months us law enforcement has arrested several university officials professors who were lying about receiving money from the chinese government they lied about or withheld the information we then learned of another story in which the us has intercepted chinese biologists claiming other people wanted them to carry sars the sars virus and flew through the united states could it be that there is something nefarious going on well according to a report from yahoo news yes there 's concern this is bioterror related many people have been paying attention with that with the people in china had to say and not their government from the national review wuhan residents dismiss official coronavirus death toll the incinerators have been working around the clock wuhan residents are increasingly skeptical of the chinese communist party 's reported coronavirus death count of approximately 2,500 deaths this was two days ago this story they say most people believe the actual number is at least 40,000 maybe the authorities are gradually releasing the real figures intentionally or unintentionally so that many people will gradually come to accept the reality a wuhan resident who gave only his surname mao told radio free asia a city 's source added that based on the aggregation of funeral and cremation numbers authorities likely know the real number and are keeping it under wraps every funeral home reports data on cremations directly to the authorities twice daily the source said this means that each funeral home only knows how many cremations it has conducted but not the situation at other funeral homes the city began lifting its lockdown in saturday after two months of mandatory shut down with a complete lift of restriction set for april 8th",0.4599,science is not always easy because often scientific research will clash with political ideology i mean look at the famous story of the heliocentric universe we know that sometimes the truth is not popular now we are seeing another controversy brown university has recently retracted a press release about a study they published on what 's called rapid onset gender dysphoria this is an idea that young people are becoming trans because of peer pressure that they spend too much time on youtube they spend too much time on tumblr and then start believing that they are gender dysphoria now people in the trans community are saying this is junk science and that it 's actually erasing the experiences of many trans people there 's an argument that the reason we are seeing an increase in so many transgender individuals is because the public is now being more accepting of it and thus young people have less to fear by coming out so let us take a look at exactly what this study is and let us take a look at the arguments on both sides and the argument as to why brown university took down this press release so we will start with science daily rapid onset gender dysphoria august 22nd 2018 summary rapid onset gender dysphoria might spread through groups of friends and maybe a harmful coping mechanism a new study suggests but more research is needed until recently it was unusual for a team to report initial feelings of gender dysphoria during or after puberty without childhood symptoms clinicians have reported this kind of gender dysphoria is on the rise particularly for patients whose sex was observed to be female at birth additionally the numbers of adolescents seeking care for gender dysphoria has increased dramatically it is unknown why these changes are occurring this month a brown university researcher published the first study to empirically describe teens and young adults who did not have symptoms of gender dysphoria during childhood but who are observed by their parents to rapidly develop gender dysphoria symptoms over days weeks or months during or after puberty littman 's surveyed more than 250 parents of children who suddenly developed gender dysphoria symptoms during or after puberty she said she wanted to better understand the phenomenon which seems to be on the rise but had been considered atypical even just a few years ago gender dysphoria is defined as the emotional distress a person because of the difference between their experienced gender identity and their sex observed at birth gender dysphoria is not the same as gender nonconformity or not following the stereotypes of one 's assigned gender the children of the parents surveyed were more than 80 percent female at birth and ranged between 11 and 27 years old at the time of the survey with an average age of 16 additionally 47 % of the children were reported as academically gifted and 41 % expressed a non heterosexual sexual orientation prior to their gender dysphoria symptoms most of the parent respondents were female white and us residents in the 90 question survey littman asked for parents about each of the eight indicators for gender dysphoria in childhood that are detailed by the american psychiatric association to meet the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in childhood a child needs to experience at least six of the eight indicators most include readily observable signs such as a strong rejection of typically feminine or masculine toys and games and a strong resistance to wearing typically feminine or masculine clothes 80 % of the parents reported observing none of these indicators in their children before puberty among the noteworthy patterns littman found in the survey data 21 % of parents reported their child had one or more friends become transgender identified at around the same time 20 % reported an increase in their child 's social media use around the same time as experienced gender dysphoria symptoms and 45 % reported both the pattern of clusters of teens in friend groups becoming transgender identified the group dynamics of these friend groups and the types of advice viewed online led her to the hypothesis that friends and online sources could spread certain beliefs examples include the belief that nonspecific symptoms such as feeling uncomfortable in their own skin or feeling like they do not fit in which could be part of normal puberty or associated with trauma should be perceived as gender dysphoria the belief that the only path to happiness is transition and the belief that anyone who disagrees with the teen is transphobic and should be cut out of their life of the parents who provided information about their child 's friendship group about a third responded that more than half of the kids in the friendship group became a transgender identified littman said a group with 50 % of its members becoming transgender identified it represents a rate that is more 70 times the expected prevalence for young adults now i apologize for reading so much of that study,0.524,"and i will interrupt myself to talk about some other things but he begins by saying when debating the wisdom of the constitution 's second amendment the media tends to start from the presumption that the question is purely scientific and that the answers can and should be derived from statistical analyzes and relentless experimentation and let me stop right there because there was another article out yesterday from a statistician who said after researching gun violence i no longer believe in gun control this is a woman named leila briscoe who was a liberal formerly of nate silver 's 538 site where they gather all the you know information a lot of the electoral statistics she crunched the numbers in a study of all 33,000 gun homicides in the united states annually she went in thinking that the usual liberal menu of anti - gun policies would reduce that number dramatically she came out concluding that the only selling point of anti - gun policies is that gun owners hate them you know how we on the right with trump are being accused of only doing things to make liberals cry she says this is the only reason to do this and here 's what she said i researched the strictly tightened gun laws in britain and australia and concluded that they do not prove much about what america 's policy should be neither nation experienced drops and mass shootings or other gun related that could be attributed to their buybacks and bans mass shootings were too rare in australia for their absence after the buyback program to be clear evidence of progress and in both australia and britain the gun restrictions had an ambiguous effect on other gun related crimes or deaths when i looked at the other off praise policies i found that no gun owner walks into the store to buy an assault weapon finally someone on the left figures this out it 's an invented classification that includes any semi - automatic that has two or more features such as a bayonet mount a rocket - propelled grenade launcher mount a folding stock or a pistol grip but guns are modular and any hobbyist can easily add these features at home just as if they were snapping together legos that 's one of the things that this guy did he had what are they called bump stocks and you do not even need a bump stock to turn a semi - automatic into an automatic it 's really a question of handling the recoil the recoil so he goes on to say as my co - workers and i kept looking at the data it seemed less and less clear that one broad gun control restriction could make a big difference two - thirds of gun deaths in the united states every year are suicides this is what happens when a liberal looks at facts suddenly suddenly they become us what is you know what is a conservative a conservatives a liberal who looks at facts all right let me get back to this charlie cook piece because i think it 's just excellent this is the second amendment is not up for debate he says the statistical approach is mistaken the right of the people to keep and bear arms is not the product of the latest research fads or exquisitely tortured data journalism but a natural extension of the lockean principles on which this country was founded it must be protected as such the declaration of independence presumes that all men enjoy certain inalienable rights and among them are life and liberty practically speaking it both the state level as a bulwark against tyranny and at the individual level as a means by which to protect oneself this necessitates the auxiliary right to the private ownership of arms which in the common law the preceded the second amendment was understood to include personal weapons in other words because of the theories and the ideas that were built up over centuries that you know ended with the lockean point of view of an about natural law we have a right a god - given right remember these rights were endowed by our creator - life and liberty and part of those rights we defend your liberty and to defend your life you need to be able to be armed okay",0.5262
oh it 's going to happen it 's not going to happen next week or nine days later her point is he 's just a liar and a buffoon and of course it did happen and that 's just one of a million examples you know another one chris hayes on msnbc he 's been tweeting how china is quite literally doing a better job at their coronavirus response than us and then of course it just comes out today that that china is fudging the numbers which we all knew like why would china be giving us their real numbers of course so the problem is that when someone 's talking to you they might know something you do not but you have to be really careful about it now because the trusted names are not that trusted right now and one of the things that i have had the but actually say it 's a blessing a blessing of is is that i get to sit across from interesting people every week and i always try to sit there as if they do know something that i do not know and i think one of the reasons that i am able to communicate a lot of ideas in a somewhat simple fashion i suppose is because i take what a lot of these people say and i incorporate it and i compare it and contrast it to the things that i talk about and that i believe so i think this is one of the best things that you can do right now is when you are talking to somebody assume they know something you do not maybe they know something about survival so survival skills or maybe they know something about fitness or maybe they know something about about gardening or something that is valuable right now that is valuable to you right now but it does not mean just believe everything everyone says it just means that somebody might know a little bit more might have some value and by the way i mentioned this on twitter yesterday but in the last it 's three weeks or so that we have been you know in lockdown over here you guys know i got clyde or we got clyde two weeks ago,0.1021,well trump would like to cancel all future debates because he says that we need to train our fire on biden now that 's kind of an ironic claim coming from president trump who 's trained most of his fire at this point on various prosecutors going after him or on ron desantis he 's not trained in enormous amounts of fire on president biden to this point however trying to end the primaries early is obviously in trump 's best interest whether the rnc goes along with anything like that is another question according to media yesterday the trump campaign has now asked the rnc to put an end to any further primary debates following a second debate the former president donald trump skipped a note from senior advisor chris la savita was sent from the trump press office said tonight 's gop debate was as boring and inconsequential as the first debate nothing that was said will change the dynamics of the primary contest being dominated by president trump president trump has a 40 or 50 point lead in the primary election and a 10 - point lead over joe biden in the general election well that is according to one poll we talked about that poll a couple of days ago there are two separate polls that have come out since then one with biden up one one with biden up five to suggest that in the real club politics polling average for example trump is up 10 is not right in the average basically he and and biden are running within margin of error the rnc should immediately put an end to any further primary debate so we can train our fire on crooked joe biden and quit wasting time and money that could be going to evicting biden from the white house now again one of the problems here is that the arguments that team trump is going to spend all that money on evicting biden from the white house ignores the fact that an extraordinary amount of the money that is poured into trump 's campaign has been spent on his legal bills and will going forward be spent on his legal bills particularly if all of his assets are locked up in new york because of this fraud case meanwhile president trump is is doing the trump thing he did this uaw speech the other day that was not to the uaw it was about the uaw and um stagecraft you could call it stagecraft you could also call it fibbing so president trump stacked the room apparently with a bunch of his own supporters many of whom are not union members in fact there was one person carrying a sign that said union members for for trump who then admitted to the press that he was not in fact a union member and had basically been handed the sign according to the uk guardian when donald trump gave a speech in michigan on wednesday seeking to capitalize on the uaw strike at least two crowd members holding signs saying union members for trump and auto workers for trump turned out to be neither according to the detroit news one individual in the crowd who held the sign that said union members for trump acknowledged she was not a union member when approached by a reporter after the event another person with a sign that red auto workers for trump said he was not an auto worker when asked for an interview both people did not provide their names the paper said that between four and 500 people attended the event it was at a non - unionized automotive parts supplier in clinton township so even go to like a unionized shop he went to like a non - union shop to do a speech about how the uaw workers deserve more and how they are being screwed by president biden now again the general message that trump gave with regard to biden and electric vehicle mandates and all the rest a lot of that is true however again the manipulation of the stagecraft is pretty wild it 's pretty wild,0.3517,"there was a time not that long ago when posted comments on internet forums or chat rooms was seen as something only computer geeks or people living in their mother 's basements did but beginning around 2003 with the creation of myspace this kind of activity started becoming mainstream and would soon take over most aspects of people 's lives myspace became a thing of the past as people moved over to facebook and then instagram twitter and snapchat came on the scene today most people feel that they need to have social media accounts not just to communicate with friends but to share their views and opinions with the world helping to get some likes retweets and followers once these social media tech companies included trending lists and hashtags countless people began feeding the machine constantly hoping to get noticed for a witty joke or controversial comment about what 's going on the trending boxes would start compiling lists about the most talked about topics giving people an insight into what were supposedly the things being posted about the most and most people stopped going to to websites directly which were often bookmarked in their browsers as a sort of favorites list and instead started following the accounts of people businesses television shows etc on social media this made companies like facebook twitter the middlemen which now stand in between people and the websites that they used to visit directly because of the simplicity of aggregating so many different websites into a single feed these new middlemen have left people vulnerable of course to an array of censorship and manipulation most people never considered the complexities and dangerous precedents that have been set by relying on a handful of mega corporations for the distribution of information or the risks of allowing themselves to become vulnerable to the ambiguous agenda driven terms of service which dictate what is supposedly hate speech or harassment and the big tech companies changed so rapidly that in just a few years twitter went from a website where people posted tweets you 140 character statements is what they started off at to a place to watch live football games in 2016 they signed a deal with the nfl to live stream games and over two million people began watching them that way even amazon.com once only a bookstore now produces original television series and films through amazon studios jeff bos is attending the golden globes and the oscars for producing films and television shows like manchester by the sea and transparent about a transgender ar get it transparent netflix also evolved from just a streaming service to producing original content youtube is producing original shows now and both facebook and apple jumped into the content producing business as well because of all this a record number of people have canceled and continue to cancel their cable subscriptions these are the people called cord cutters and with netflix and hulu and other streaming services offering on demand streams of shows from popular television networks and disney and hbo and discover channel and others having their own streaming apps more and more people are abandoning traditional television things have gotten so strange in our modern media world that even instagram fact checks users posts an app designed for sharing photos because sometimes the creators of new technology can not imagine how people will use it in ways that it was not intended for and people have been able to turn their instagram accounts into powerful information warfare feeds simply by posting memes instead of selfies instagram also ban certain hashtags trying to suppress information not to mention certain memes are deemed a violation of their terms of service like this one instagram censored from my account showing the scooby - doo team unveiling the real culprit behind the jesse smette attack they said this violated their harassment and bullying policy and this one a nice white family with the caption white people the only race you can legally discriminate against that was hate speech they said so they took it down when it was clearly a meme designed to expose discrimination against white people but just standing up for white people these days and pointing out systemic anti - h ism is deemed racist so now memes get dumped down the memory hole meanwhile rappers like 50 cent soldja boy and others have posted death threats on their instagram accounts but they do not get suspended barack obama appeared on the national stage at the same time social media was rapidly integrating into our lives and and having a facebook page was becoming almost as standard as having a cell phone his inner circle of political operatives saw the communication landscape was changing and they jumped on it immediately obama was seen as the first social media president and was the first president to have a facebook page and a twitter account the white house would later get its own youtube channel and since people are no longer limited to getting their information from the major news networks and our society rapidly moved away from newspapers magaz azines to online websites blogs and social media pages not only did these new media monopolies begin manipulating the flow of information that users are posting and viewing but cunning individuals within the government looked for opportunities to manipulate users of this new technology as well an executive in the obama administration recommended that the government pay online trolls to flood the comment sections on websites and videos in attempts to discredit certain posts they deemed conspiracy theories or from supposed extremists cass sunstein who headed up the white house office of information and regulatory affairs for obama wrote that such a plan will quote undermine the crippled epistemology of believers by planting doubts about the theories and stylized facts that circulate within such groups thereby introducing beneficial cognitive diversity a few years earlier a military intelligence officer and defense analyst drew up a white paper discussing the growing popularity of blogs and independent news websites and explored the possibility of incorporating blogs blogging into military strategy primarily as a tool for influence the paper blogs and military information strategy also flowed the idea of hiring bloggers to attack people and promote certain causes it also suggested the government hack popular blogs and make subtle changes in articles not just to spread propaganda but to discredit the writers these tactics were proposed before the social media era which took the information age to a whole new level of user interactions through internet comments as people began to rely on these websites and apps to communicate with their friends family and the world at large an investigation into the official obamacare facebook page in 2014 found that the majority of the over 200,000 comments were from a small handful of users who were most likely paid shills to give the false impression that everyone loved the new law barack obama 's nonprofit group organizing for action declined to comments if they were paying people to post but it 's clear from the extraordinary number of posts from the same few accounts that this was an organized online campaign the government actually paid webmd the popular health and medical website $ 14 million to promote obamacare those payments were not even kept a secret and were listed in the budget of the department of health and human services a private foundation called the california endowment even paid $ 500,000 to television networks to incorporate pro- obamacare plot lines into tv sitcoms and other shows all of this makes for a fascinating and complex media landscape which is difficult to navigate without getting lost in an endless maze of hyperlinks and millions of people and countless companies and organizations simultaneously hoping to be heard followed and believed d",0.154,yes really uh all of that coming up and much more packed show today a lot to cover we will begin here um only hours after the shooting of jacob lake by kenosha police the narrative had already solidified that 's all it takes these days sometimes not even hours a narrative can take shape in mere minutes but in this case in spite of the fact that all we had to go on was a short video of police shooting a man while he leaned inside his car the media had rendered its verdict jacob blake was an unarmed victim gunned down by police after he stopped to innocently break up a fight between two other people well there were questions though was he unarmed was he breaking up a fight why was he reaching into the car what exactly happened between blake and the police right before the shooting and why were the police there in the first place these were open questions and now the answers to those questions are finally uh coming to light and you know it should not surprise us that the answers do not line up with the narrative as they uh so rarely do these days so let us go through what we know first of all according to wisconsin media outlet madison 365 which obtained audio from the police scanner on the night of the shooting blake 's girlfriend had called 9 - 1 - 1 to report that blake was at her home um and was not supposed to be there and had taken her keys and would not give them back police responding to the scene were informed that blake had an open warrant for his arrest it had been previously reported rather quietly by the media that blake was wanted for sexual assault trespassing and uh and domestic abuse as well now this fact alone does not directly vindicate the officers but this the scanner audio is significant for a few reasons first of all um it shows that the eyewitnesses who claimed that blake was breaking up a fight were wrong those eyewitnesses were apparently lying or if we want to be generous and see the best in people assume the best we will say they were mistaken the police were summoned to the scene because of apparently blake 's own actions of course it should not be a revelation that eyewitness reports are often unreliable especially where high - profile police shootings are concerned we should always keep in mind that the black lives matter organization rose to prominence on the back of false eyewitness reports in ferguson about michael brown putting up his hands and yelling hands up do not shoot you know if it was not for that original false report and false narrative who knows where we 'd be today would we have all of this chaos in writing i do not know unfortunately there 's there 's even more reason though these days to doubt eyewitness reports as these shootings are not happening in a vacuum witnesses on the scene know what sorts of things they should say in order to frame the narrative in an unfavorable light for police we do not know if the apparent false information in this case was intentional or not but the temptation to give false information in this intensely anti - police environment must be very strong this is only added on top of the well - established fact that eyewitness reports in general are incredibly inaccurate and that 's something that we have known for a long time also the flak the fact that blake had apparently taken someone 's keys raises more critical questions about what he was doing when he walked to the car where his kids were reportedly sitting and opened the door with police guns trained on him was he reaching for something was it even his car did he intend to drive away now it seems there could have been potentially more than one reason why police would want to open fire or would have a reason to open fire if he was going for a weapon of some kind that would be clear justification for an equal response from police if he has a wanted sexual and domestic abuser was about to flee the scene with a van full of kids possibly involving the children in a dangerous high - speed chase that could be another reason for police to stop him by whatever means necessary or if the police had reason to suspect good reason to suspect either of those um possibilities and that could be a reason for them too and then the other shoe dropped later on later yesterday the wisconsin doj finally released some information that filled in most of the rest of the puzzle we are told that when police arrived on the scene they tried to arrest blake he resisted they tried to use non - lethal measures a taser he resisted that too he told them he had a knife in his possession he went to his car while they screamed for him to stop he reached they shot then they recovered a knife on the floorboard of his car so it 's a review wanted domestic abuser uh girlfriend calls police on him police come to make the arrest he resists fight back fights back goes to his car reaches in knife is recovered was he already holding the knife was he reaching for it was he reaching for something else and the knife just happened to be there there are still aspects of the story that remain unclear,0.505,well the president of the united states is wildly unpopular and a lot of people have attributed that to his policies the fact that his policies are all about gigantic government spending or equity at the center of all things or weak foreign policy including the pullout from afghanistan but the reality is that the reason that joe biden has been sinking in the polls is because americans do not like him personally unlike barack obama where the polls showed they like the guy personally they do not like his policies with joe biden the two are just intertwined joe biden is not liked personally and the turning point for him was actually the pullout from afghanistan until that point the widespread perception that he was a kindly elderly gentleman was not all there but in essence was a fairly okay guy but when he pulled out from afghanistan and basically said i do not care what happens there when there are people falling off wheel wells and american soldiers getting blown up in his entire administration sitting there talking about what a wonderful job they were doing that really sunk the perception of the american public about him but he has now underscored that in radical terms because of his association with his son hunter so the public mind with regard to hunter biden has shifted to it started off with hunter biden derelict bad guy drug abuser pornography abuser prostitute abuser a guy a bad person but joe you know decent dad trying to take care of his drug addicted son trying to make sure that his son was okay sympathetic figure and then as all these corruption stories roll out these stories about how hunter was going around picking up giant bags of cash from foreign sources and joe was in all likelihood benefiting from that the documents on hunter biden 's laptop in which hunter biden is bragging to his daughter about funding daddy the documents from his laptop suggesting that joe was taking part in meetings either by phone or sometimes even in person stopping by meetings and saying hello documents suggesting that hunter biden was saying two foreign officials that joe biden was sitting next to him as he attempted to essentially pry money out of them he combined that with joe biden 's treatment of hunter biden 's illegitimate daughter and things start to go bad for joe biden in terms of public perception real fast so lurking in the background of the biden family story has always been this idea that they are incredibly tribal that if you are a biden then you get to benefit from the sweetheart deals that are associated with the biden last name if you are frank biden you can go around pick up cash joe biden 's brother if you are a hunter you can go around pick up cash because of course you are a member of the corrupt biden family but if they choose not to give you the name if they decide that they are not going to extend the name came to you then you are basically cut off at the knees and who better to apply that logic to than a small baby so as we all know at this point hunter biden had a sexual relationship with a woman in london roberts london roberts was acting apparently as his quasi assistant and by quasi assistant would mean that hunter was basically using her not just for her secretarial abilities but for apparently other purposes and reasons sexual in nature and she bore a child by him whom she named navy joan navy joan was bay was born way back in 2019 .,0.5639,i do not buy it it meanwhile in other news it must be pointed out that there are hundreds of rockets a day that are now falling on israel i am getting emails from people videos from people who are legitimately living in their basements they are living in bomb shelters right now across israel because of hundreds of rockets that are descending from the gaza strip before you say this is because of the quote unquote about occupation recognized that for 12 years israel has not been present in the gaza strip the gaza strip is run by a terrorist group called hamas and that terrorist group has routinely used the gaza strip as a staging point for attacks on israelis they have built terror tunnels to try and kidnap israelis they have tried to breach the border in order to invade israeli land they burn thousands of acres of israeli lands with with kites that have incendiaries attached to them and balloons they have incendiaries attached to them and now they are firing rockets randomly into civilian areas you are not seeing this covered in the media because the media do not care when jews get killed in israel and the media do not care about that the media pretend to care about anti - semitism in a serious way when jews get killed in pittsburgh because then they can try and blame president trump and they can talk about right - wing anti - semitism which is a brand of anti - semitism does exist when it comes to radical muslim anti - semitism they go completely silent for the same reason that president obama once said about a radical islamist attack on a kosher supermarket in france that it was random it was not an system it was a random attack a the idea that it is not the same anti - semitism that drives hamas attacks on israeli civilians as drives attacks on a show in pittsburgh is a bunch of crap it is simply nonsense and what you are going to see from the press is nothing about the hundreds of rockets falling into the civilian areas of a democratic ally of the united states until israel fights back at which point you are going to see the press say mikey israel strikes the poor aquiver in palestinian population and all the palestinians have to do in the gaza strip is elect a government that is not come us all they have to do is elect a government that wants to make peace with israel and then open up their markets and the capital would come flowing in gaza has natural nice seaside territory but they are not going to do that because there 's an ideological and ideological commitments the destruction of israel and the murder of jews these rockets are not directed at military installations this is not a war this is an attack on a civilian population very deliberately and the media will ignore it up till the point when israel fights back at which point they will blame the jews that is in and of itself an aspect of leftist anti - semitism that manifests itself every time the media covered the conflict between israel and the palestinian authority and hamas and islamic jihad every time that conflict breaks out the media suggests that israel is at the top of the of the power hierarchy and therefore hamas is attacks on israel are not really anti - semitic it 's really about power relationships and this is how they cover for radical muslim anti - semitism but what we are watching right now schools being hit bakeries being hit and there 's there 's 52 israelis who have gone to hospitals thanks to bombs randomly falling in their midst again hundreds of rockets being shot every day i mean this is the worst it 's been in israel since the 2014 gaza war it 's really been quite awful over there you can see the videos online that will never be covered by the mainstream media there 's a pretty heartbreaking video of a dog that had been that had been fatally wounded by a rocket that just fell into a civilian area now all of this again will be ignored by the global media up until the point at which israel starts to defend itself at which point israel will be condemned for disproportionate force and all of the people on the on the left like the j streets of the world will condemn israel at that point demonstrate exactly what it is that they are which is a bunch of anti - semitic enablers if you are enabling all of this then you are then you are part of the problem and meanwhile in other news over in florida the recount process continues to be a complete crap tornado it 's a disaster according to mark caputo over at politico broward election chief is likely to be forced from office by rick scott and ron de santos that makes perfect sense that makes perfect sense because again she 's awful at her job her name is brenda snipes here 's what marc caputo writes counting all awful votes destroying ballots sunshine law violations busted deadlines so many controversies have bedeviled broward county election supervisor brenda snipes culminating in her off his troubles in the aftermath of florida 's chaotic 2018 elections that her days in office are now numbered insiders and lawmakers say she was bound by law to start turning in election results within 24 hours of the of the actual election taking place instead it took her a week,0.9337,so if you are starting a news company who are you going to make content for men or women well if you target women your demographic will be larger but equally as important is that women interact with brands more often 55 percent versus only 36 percent of men what does that mean advertisers will be more interested in articles that target women than they do men because their click - through rate will likely be higher among women it is possible these brands these companies will make more money if they produce content targeting women heading over to pew internet research gives us a little bit more data women use facebook more than men they use instagram more than men they are equal on linkedin which is business oriented but they are still more active on twitter when it comes to social media sites facebook is the most important this story from august 18 2015 facebook has taken over from google as a traffic source for news the article from fortune cites parsley which shows that facebook is the largest driver of traffic to news websites surpassing google and although recently that may have flipped this story from recode google is replacing facebook 's traffic to publishers it 's important to realize that facebook is still one of the largest sources of traffic for these news websites many of these sites already have search engine optimization to make sure that if you search on google you will find their new site but even if facebook is waning in terms of dominance for driving traffic to their site they are still going to heavily prioritize getting shares in order to get those views in which case women being the primary sharers of information being the primary users of social media they are going to be the likely target for many news organizations looking at the american marketing association website we can see this article from august of 2017 what makes online content viral research shows its anger shock and awe they say content that triggered certain emotions was especially likely to go viral specifically content that made people angry was the most likely to go viral with a 34 percent greater chance than average content that was all inspiring was second at 30 percent greater than average content that inspired feelings of sadness as the researchers predicted was less likely to go viral actually 13 percent below average so there 's the data not only do women share more than men not only are they more active on most social media especially where it matters they are more likely to share if something makes them feel or to show their friends and family what they care about and when we look at the data that says anger is the most likely emotion to get someone to share it is unsurprising that so many news organizations are producing content to piss women off the results can be fairly obvious this story from voxcom just last month republicans have a millennial women problem nearly 70 % of young women say they are leaning toward democratic candidates in the midterms now fox cites pew internet research and they show us this graphic by wide margin young women favor the democratic candidate in their district and we can see among ages 18 to 34 women are 68 percent democratic and only 24 % republican whereas men are 4 7 % democratic and 50 % republican now men are pretty evenly split but they do lean towards republican and women overwhelmingly lean democratic the trend is fairly similar among ages 35 to 49 but the gap is a bit lower for women with 52 % of women being democratic and 36 % being republican although the numbers are fairly similar for men but it would seem that among ages 35 to 49 some men do not move over to the republicans but probably go third party because they are nearly 10 points down on the democratic side do you want to ask me why i think today millennial men lean republican a little bit and women overwhelmingly lean democratic a few reasons a lot of content degrades men says that their oppressors that they are toxic and things like that when a young man reads that he 's probably going to get angry or offended and be put off this is not going to make them share the content because it 's not something they care about not only that men do not really share that often because they care they share to entertain their friends so in effect what we see is bubbles forming where men are getting angry that they are being attacked and do not really want to share this kind of stuff,0.3083,so this does sound like these are federal charges his lawyer janine vinci declined to comment thursday in a statement fbi special agent michael j driscoll denounced demuro 's actions dominic demurrow put a thumb on the scale for certain candidates in exchange for bribes as public trust in the electoral process is vital the fbi 's message today is clear election interference of any kind by hostile foreign actors or dishonest local officials will not be tolerated the investigation is ongoing and those with information on election fraud are asked to contact the fbi now this is scary this guy was was swinging the vote for federal elections now you got to understand we have found evidence of one person doing one thing in a small election with about you know 1700 votes in some in some votes only 118 votes cast he was absolutely putting weight on the scales which says to me it may have actually swung the vote however what you got to realize is that there are a bunch of different districts the districts all vote and then that trickles up think about this how this think about how that would work in a federal election you would need guys like him people like him in many different districts to swing an election but there are key places where this is possible you might find a county with only a few hundred people you only need a couple dozen fake votes and that county turns a certain color and then that provides you know delegates or whatever depending on the kind of primary they are doing uh the kind of election they are doing being a primary or federal election regardless of how severe or how you know how much this actually swayed the elections we got to take this stuff seriously it looks like the fbi does now recently donald trump here 's new york times reported donald trump steps up a tax on mail voting making false claims about fraud president trump initially said he might withhold federal funding for for michigan and nevada if the states move forward in expanding vote by vote by mail though he later backed off the threat trump is taking this very very seriously but there 's something interesting i want to talk about before i show you actual questionable instances one of the concerns i see for republicans is that mail - in voting is likely to increase youth youth turnout in my opinion actually that was my opinion until it was proven false at least so far what i was thinking was well while voter fraud is a very serious issue we need to pay attention to one of the things that will negatively impact republicans is that vote by mail will increase the amount of apathetic voters so you have got young people who do not care to vote they get about in the mail and they say sure fine whatever they fill it out and just put it back in the mailbox this is a huge advantage for democrats which is why it makes sense in my opinion they 'd want to change the rules right now you have people who want to vote voting people who do not want to vote do not vote how do you get people who do not want to vote to vote put the belt right in their face,0.2963,but if we can step back and say are for example space and time features of the universe as a whole is the universe eternal or infinite in various dimensions does a god exist or not uh those are all metaphysical metaphysical questions so to come back to this is just the one more point that i want to make is that all of the things that we talk about when we start talking about sense perception and forming concepts and grammar and logic and stories and statistics all of that has to work right from the beginning with doing some philosophy of mind that is to say what is this thing that we call the mind and one of the things that early modern philosophy now this is 1400s 1500s on into the 1600s was simultaneously struggling with was understanding the human being and if uh for example you have what was common for many centuries i say a dualistic understanding of the human being that the human being is a body but also a soul or or a physicality plus a spiritual element and that these are two very different metaphysical things right one is subject to corruption and the other is in in principle eternal uh and that they have you know different ontological makeups different agendas different ultimate destinies then on the metaphysics side you know how do those two come together how do they work together how do they fit together what 's the proper understanding of of those two but that metaphysical understanding of what it is to be a human being will shape how you think about epistemology right from the get - go so if you are say an empiricist uh and you want to say well we start in say the physical world and i have a physical body with physical senses and there 's a causal story about how those interact with each other but somehow i have to get that across this metaphysical gulf from the physical to the spiritual so that my mind which i think of as being on the spirit side of things or on the soul side of things can confront it and then do various things that we that we uh we think we are going to do with our with our minds our reason and our emotions and so forth and that metaphysical gulf if you can can not bridge that gulf metaphysically uh is going to cause you problems epistemologically and so one reason why we end up in postmodernism a few centuries later i think is not only going to be because the early empiricist theories had problems the early rationalist theories had problems various attempts to overcome them like kant led to problems and so forth it was not only that there were epistemological problems that worked themselves out and led it to dead ends but at the same time we were struggling with the metaphysical problem as i am thinking of it the mind body problem and once we said uh or once we were starting from the perspective that ideas or non - physical realities or stories are non - physical realities and they are in a mind and we are conceiving conceiving of that as something separate from the physical world as a non - physical world it 's a very difficult to try to find how that then relates back to that physical world so i would say in your field for example where you come out of professional psychology it 's interesting that professional psychology only came on board in the late 1800s uh and so we say you know this is the my potted history of your your discipline we have the early freudians and the early behaviorists both coming on board in 1900 and one of the things that they are both trying to do is to say well finally we can start to study the mind scientifically we can have a science of the mind but what they were reacting against was still in the 1800s was the idea that the mind somehow do not fit into nature it was an extra natural thing it was a a ghost in the machine and the the fitting of the ghost in the machine we do not have a theory that that that works this out and both of them uh were of course reflecting on darwin and darwin 's more robust ly naturalistic understanding of the human being that we are going to see the mind not as a ghost that 's in the wet wear or in the biological wear but as a some sort of emergent phenomenon or a bipod but it 's only when we stop thinking about uh uh the human being as a ghost plus a machine to use that metaphor or a spirit plus a body as two different things as much more of a naturalist integrit then we start to think that we can do sci psychology science ific al now the 4ans and the behaviorists i think they were both disasters in various ways they were genius but they you know this is again the early steps of science but what they are starting to do though is say we are not going to study the human being uh we are going to study the human being as part of the natural world and but notice that this is now into the 1900s and psychology is a very new science and this is already 30 00 years after modern philosophy had been taken over in a sense by the epistemologist and had worked their way into a very skeptical form so my hope is uh if we are talking about where the future has to go know psychology has been online for a century now a little more than a century now extraordinarily complex stuff as as we all know,0.1998,but they knew that there was there was one sent from god even in john 101 john was to foreshadow demands from god john said i behold the lamb of god he do not say john do not know that jesus was god according to you all john do not know that jesus was god john had no idea jesus was the second person of the trinity he do not know he said behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sins of the world he acts the lamb of god to baptize him jesus said obviously said no you need to baptize me john baptize the lamb of god and then in a vision the father said my son whom i am well pleased the father is up here the son is here the father is saying i am pleased with the son why is that significant because the jews only believed in the father and if the father says something the jews believe that god approved this man right here they do not see a trinity some of you all do but jesus do not you know god is not a man that he should he should lie nor the son of man that he should repent god is not a man that means that he can not be subject to the human condition i do not know why people are forgetting that scripture god is not a man that he should lie nor the son of man that he shall not a man is allowed a son of man that he should repent god can not sin god can not die god can not be subject to any rules and regulations none,0.3948,i am sorry i am sorry not that 's not the number it was around 9 to 10 million democrats voted for donald trump in 2016 and it was 12 to 18 percent of bernie sanders supporters who voted for donald trump like i mentioned with joe rogan i think it 's very likely we are going to see some bernie or bust individuals vote for trump out of spite but there 's even one small account called bernie or else what does that mean well as we have seen in the past there is a real fear that bernie sanders supporters get violent i mean there 's that the dnc is being postponed we will see how things play out but there was a very real fear of rioting and now you have people act you know bernie sanders himself had to condemn the violence that it erupted in 2016 but we have already seen it from the veritas video leaked so we will go through all of this will we see widespread protests violence i think so absolutely because i was there at the dnc in 2016 i saw how the left reacted to what hillary clinton and the dnc had done to bernie sanders and now here we are you think joe biden is a better bet i think it 's clear to everybody the dnc would rather lose to trump and let bernie sanders win and while many trump supporters would probably agree that they would not want bernie sanders how do you think that makes bernie sanders supporters feel that bernie actually can think straight and even look even if you think has bad ideas the dude could actually talk about stuff joe biden is a joke an absolute joke it is a practical joke being made upon all of the bernie supporters not only is the dnc saying you can not win we will not let you,0.5595,so i guess there is they were playing the song edelweiss at the white house and maggie haberman of the democrat party i mean of the media i mean of the new york times or whatever she writes for she said they were playing edelweiss do they know what that song means she 's trying to call trump and not see because adel vice comes from the sound of music what she forgets is that it was sung by people opposing the nazis in the sound of music that exemplifies how the media have gotten this story wrong from the very beginning and that is why the day began before they released the redacted report the day began with attorney general william barre giving a press conference on the report why they are releasing the report why certain parts of the report have been redacted and taking reporters questions the main takeaway here the main takeaway from this whole press conference is that attorney general william barr has an iq at least twice that of every reporter in that room combined it was dizzying and distressing to look at how stupid the reporters came off and how well william barr came off this guy is no joke the media are now trying to present him as some sort of hack private lawyer for president trumpet can not do that with william barr william barr was the attorney general in 1991 william barr has been around a long time he 's a very smart guy he 's very serious guy he 's a very well - respected guy that really came through in this press conference he actually reminded me a lot of antonin scalia the way that he would listen to questions the way he could identify instantly where these reporters were going and the way he just clobbered them with the answer so the left has been going after william bar for a couple of weeks now the question that is to be asked is is the summary that william barr gave of the muller report a fair assessment or an unfair assessment is the assessment that he gave basically correct when he released his four - page report a couple weeks ago or is he covering up and spinning and trying to fix the media for donald trump here is attorney general bars main takeaway counsel found no evidence that any american including anyone associated with the trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the russian government or the ira in this illegal scheme indeed as the report states quote the investigation did not identify evidence that any us person knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the iras interference operation unquote put another way the special counsel found no collusion by any americans in iras illegal activities no collusion he makes a point of simplifying this for people the special counsel found no collusion now we have known this for a while i think even the sophisticated democrats in the media have known there 's no collusion van jones a very sophisticated left - winger said a year ago over a year ago the russia thing is a nothing burger so then the question comes down to was there obstruction so there 's no collusion it 's not as though president trump was working with vladimir putin to fix the 2016 election but even though there was no collusion was there obstruction so once the muller investigation began did president trump try to obstruct the investigation now it 's a perfectly legitimate question to ask how can you obstruct an investigation when there 's no underlying crime if i have not committed a crime how can i be said to try to obstruct an investigation into a crime that never happened that 's a that 's a fair question arguments on both sides which we will get to in a second here but did president trump behave in some crooked way to fix this investigation to fix the conclusions here to work with bar to work with muller to work with any of these things did he obstruct justice now the mainstream are furious today and democrats are furious because william bar and the doj briefed the white house on the report so this is now their big takeaway and they are saying this is the evidence of some corruption here in the trump administration in the doj because the attorney general briefed the president 's team before releasing it to congress and before giving this press conference and before releasing it to the press william bar clears up this question which all of the news media have been going on and prattling on about four hours chuck todd said it was evidence that trump colluded with the attorney general william bar gives the very simple explanation of why the white house was briefed on this report following my march 29th letter the office of the white house counsel requested the opportunity to review the redacted version of the report in order to advise the president on the potential invocation of privilege which is consistent with long - standing practice following that review the president confirmed that in the interest of transparency and full disclosure to the american people he would not assert privilege over the special counsels report accordingly the public report i am releasing today contains redactions only for the four categories that i previously outlined and no material has been redacted based on executive privilege very important that he makes this point because they say will you brief to the white house they are going to cook this up they are going to interfere with its release,0.274,i had a conversation with a bioethicists who was a teacher of mine in a summer program and she asked me my views on abortion and i said i think it 's fine and i gave all these dumb arguments and she shot down each and every one of them and i had my eyes opened on the subject i am not the only one some of the most prominent voices in support of abortion have flipped and become some of the most prominent voices in support of life when they examined the evidence when they saw the reality of abortion i am talking about norma mccorvey you might not recognize that name but you would recognize her pseudonym which is jane row the woman who was used by opportunistic lawyers in roe versus wade the case that 47 years ago invented the fictional constitutional right to abortion that woman became one of the most prominent pro - life advocates in the country she said that her participation in roe versus wade her allowing herself to be used by those predator lawyers was the biggest regret of her life how about dr . bernard nathanson dr . bernard nathanson was the founder of nay ral that was the national abortion rights league they have changed what the letters mean over the years but it remains the most prominent pro - abortion advocacy organization in the country i suppose other than planned parenthood that guy co - founder of nay ral became a very prominent pro - life advocate because he saw the reality of abortion and he also exposed a lot of the lies that the abortion industry tells you like for instance they would say before roe vs. wade 5000 women a year were dying from back - alley abortions turns out that 's completely made - up as bernard nathanson said that they plucked that number out of thin air it just sounded good actually when you look at the numbers you are talking about a couple dozen or a few dozen women who died from back - alley abortions and as a just a percentage of the abortion procedures done in states where abortion was legal and where it was illegal it was no less safe than legal abortions at that time it was just a complete lie peddled by the abortion industry dr . bernard nathanson became a huge pro - life advocate abby johnson abby johnson is the focus of that movie unplanned abby johnson worked for planned parenthood she was being promoted up the ranks then she saw the reality of abortion now she is a major pro - life advocate we have changed our minds on that subject it 's important to be able to change your minds when new evidence presents itself in every single day the evidence becomes clearer on the side of life you know if we were to just lock ourselves in a box and just think abstractly about abortion still the arguments would be clearly on the side of life still they would all be against abortion but if you just locked yourself in a box and thought about it or had a philosophical debate over a couple drinks with a friend maybe you could rationalize the case for abortion it 's very easy to rationalize things,0.6474,merchamer also claims that the ukraine president yanukovych deposed in 2014 in the aftermath of widespread pro - eu protests was the clear favorite and choice of the russian - speaking ukrainians who overwhelmingly occupy the southeastern section of the country well zielinski the current president and supporter of all things western was and is supported by the ukrainian speakers who live in the northeast add to that as well the fact that the ukrainian - speaking supported government has placed increasingly draconian restrictions on the language rights of the russian speakers in the northwest a fact all westerners balancing the complexities of multiple languages in their own countries should be particularly sensitive to an understanding of all this to say that putin and the russians have their reasons for concern over the situation in ukraine we could reasonably add to these two theories of the conflict some observations about the energy front russia is a petro giant providing almost 15 percent of the world 's supply of oil and natural gas and is extremely dependent on that single resource whose revenues make up almost 50 percent of the state budget and perhaps 30 percent of total gdp almost half of the russian fossil fuels exported make their way to europe which has allowed itself to become dangerously dependent on such outside sources for one of its primary necessities not least because of its faux moral stance on issues of the environment it 's not so easy for the russians to get their oil and gas to market partly because the baomoth country is remarkably landlocked in a practical sense they have had to build extensive pipelines to do so the two of those that serve the european market upon which the economy of russia is fundamentally dependent pass through what are now other countries this is not convenient to say the least for the russians has caused no shortage of conflict between them and ukraine specifically and has certainly encouraged constant russian interference in belarus which is in some real sense a puppet state of its larger partner when the soviet empire collapsed the huge oil fields around the caspian sea suddenly found themselves in the hands of the new countries of kazakhstan azerbaijan uzbekistan and turkmenistan after 1989 these resources attracted major attention from western energy companies and untrammeled production from the new countries posed a threat to russian domination of the european energy market this has produced unending tension in the region not least around azerbaijan which has run its own pipelines to thirsty western markets through georgia invaded non - coincidentally by russia in 2008 turkey and albania thus partially circumventing russian control over petro export the fact of this relative emerging independence has also allowed azerbaijan to move further away from the moscow 's centered sphere of influence and sets a worrying example in the russian view to other developing post - soviet countries in the area add to that the fact that 80 of russia 's oil and gas exports once had to pass through ukraine although this problem has been remediated somewhat and the stage was and is set for trouble this became particularly evident in 2005 with the orange revolution and the rise of victor yushenko 's overtly pro - western ukrainian regime shortly thereafter the russians demanded that ukraine turn over ownership of the pipeline system traversing that country to them this request was refused in response and during the winter the russians briefly turned off the taps supplying ukraine with the petro resources upon which that country was also acutely dependent it is also the case that ukraine has immense and relatively recently discovered circa 2010 petrol resources of its own particularly around the caspian sea and in the northeast enough natural gas for example so that it could have become a major supplier of that resource to europe and thereby pose a threat to european reliance on russian resources ukraine also possesses although perhaps not after the current war immense storage capacity for petrol resources another asset that could limit the influence that russia can exert over its european customers by providing a buffer against any suddenly imposed limitation of supply in the last decade ukraine has been actively pursuing agreements with exxonmobil shell and chevron to develop and export their new resources the 2014 pro - western revolution in ukraine toppling what was then the pro - russian government there did little to set russian mines at ease the consequent invasion of crimea placed a substantial proportion of the new ukraine petra reserves in russian hands the later invasion of the donbass region in the aforementioned northeast punitively to support pro - russian separatists there was perhaps motivated by analogous reasons so that 's three hypothetical reasons for russia and ukraine first putin the imperialist soviet - era hitlerian thug second russia threatened by careless and provocative western expansionism into a country we really do not care about except when our unearned moral virtue is challenged but which is key to russian identity and security third russian concern about maintaining its primarily petrol - funded economy particularly in relation to the european market but even three reasons are not enough to account for the fact of this war and its emergence here and now there 's a fourth precisely germane to why i entitled this essay civil war in the west in the west,0.5587,"and it it would be shocking if joe biden made it all the way through a second term without some sort of full scale mental collapse again given the fact that he will not even release tape of himself talking with one for like 5 or six hours so kamla harris confirmed on thursday she will be participating in a july debate again they are doing this early because they hope that if the republican shaxs kla harris everyone will have forgotten about it by the election trump has yet to pick his running mate obviously there a bunch of different names at the top of the heap he 's talked about jd vance from ohio tim scott is the name that seems to come up the most often from south carolina north dakota governor doug bergham has come up a lot not sure exactly why i mean i like doug burham but like where is the bergam mum you got even less support than tim scott did in the republican primaries but kla harris is announcing early that she definitely wants to debate somebody and i am sure republican definitely wants to debate her that is definitely something that donald trump should be taking into consideration who is best going to debate kamla harris would be a big question because that 's basically the only thing that matters i have no doubt that if donald trump is reelected he will serve his entire term i have a lot of doubt that if joe biden is reelected that kamla harris will not be filling out that term meanwhile kamla harris is running her own campaign her campaign right now is what if we just shovel money at you so the democrats have run out of ideas their ideas now involve what if we just throw money into an inflationary cycle we will just literally pay people to vote for us now they have been trying this for a while here with their student loan relief nonsense they have been trying this with their green boond doggles and here was k harris yesterday saying we are dropping trillions on the streets right now i was sharing with mr phelps that we the president and i because of the um inflation reduction act the b the infrastructure act we are dropping trillions of dollars on the streets of america right now to build back up our roads and our bridges our sidewalks to invest in a clean energy economy to deal with the climate crisis in a way that is about building up adaptation and resilience they they have dropped trillions into an inflationary economy and by the way as the economy continues to stagger along at a three 3.4 3.5 3.6 % inflation rate as it continues to tagger along at that rate she says she now wants government subsidized $ 25,000 grants for firsttime home buyers who can not pay their down payment i mean i feel like we did this before and it resulted in the subprime mortgage crisis because it turns out that when you pay people who can not afford a house to get a house then when the real estate values drop they go underwater they can not afford to pay their mortgage and they can not afford to sell because they pay more than they would receive for the actual sale of the home and then you get a real estate meltdown so just genius level ideas but again if you can just shovel money out at particular populations you hope they will vote for you that is the that is the old school democratic playbook and they are going right back to it here 's kl harris we have now proposed that if you are the child of parents who or you were raised in a family where the folks who raised you were not homeowners when you want to go buy a home you will be entitled to a $ 25,000 grant toward down payment for a home again acknowledging the realities of it all if your parents owned a home and then you as their child say i want to go buy then your parents will likely have the opportunity and ability to say honey you do not have to go take out that big loan i am going to take some equity out of my home to help you with that down payment sure",0.4244,"but what what coin really is like gold or silver it is an assets that the government can not control and can not touch and if you put your money in it is a great hedge against inflation and government intervention ism and because bitcoin is still growing it

limited supply bitcoin more people are buying in the value goes up so if you get an early on bitcoin you tend to do better over time just as if you invested in gold very early before a massive supply

decided to take the video down and the host of the show fellow rapper norir noriega nori apologized for giving kanye a platform now when kanye did this same podcast last year the youtube video alone got over 11 million views and this shows what a fractionalized media ecosystem we are living in now where there are these enormous shows and podcasts where the people who are outside of their viewership do not even know that they exist but in the interview that he did just the other day on the show kanye pointed out that his publicist asked him why do you want to go on this show and he said because his last interview got triple the viewers of kim kardashian 's hosting on saturday night live so i looked into this and got at least double because we got 11 million views on just on the youtube video alone who knows how many people are listening um the podcast apps kim carta and he might actually be right kim kardashian got about 5 million viewers on saturday night live so that 's the world we are living in when i had never heard of this youtube channel i 'd never heard of this show and again it has double or triple the viewership of a major a - list celebrity hosting what you know used to be a staple of american entertainment of course the liberal media industrial complex is absolutely furious not just with kanye 's comments on the podcast and on the other big tech platforms but that he now will reportedly be buying his own when parlor celebrates the free speech let us be clear kanye was not blocked from twitter and instagram because he challenged critical race theory or vaccine mandates it was because he threatened to kill jews no that 's fake news everybody knew that he meant defcon which is a defensive posture which of course he expanded on in that podcast interview that also got censored parlor is a haven of hate it 's a cesspool of bigotry that resembles 4chan a lot less than facebook no these successfuls of hate are actually the big tech platforms which are filled with anti - whitism and christian phobia from people like talbert swan a bishop at some i am just assuming satanic church which tweets out literally the same thing every few months that whiteness is an unrelenting demonic force of evil that 's just from october 14th just a couple days ago and uh here is just like i said every few months he just tweets out the exact same thing never gets suspended never gets banned allowed to demonize and dehumanize the entire white race with no penalties whatsoever afterwards spread of kanye 's plans elon musk tweet out this meme showing the two of them doing a celebratory dance it 's a scene taken from a popular anime film i think or a video game adding fun times ahead only to then quickly delete the tweets because so many of the twits on twitter were attacking elon for daring to not denounce kanye west simply for existing and instead welcoming him into the world of owning a social media platform we will see if kanye goes through with this or if he gets cold feet because even before this just from his comments recently he was already enemy number one of the liberal media industrial complex scheduled for mega cancelations cancelations that he has not even imagined and now that he is getting into the social media business to buy a free speech platform they are going to come at him even harder so we will see what happens right now they are in what 's called an agreement in principle so they have not signed the contract with the details they have signed a contract to sort of then iron out the actual contract so we will see what happens with this and look at that i got 264 000 followers on parlor but i have not used it for eight months i have not used getter in many months i have not used me we since i do not even remember when this is kind of a double - edged sword having all these different platforms it 's fantastic to have alternatives to the big tech platforms but at the same time it fractionalizes the audience because not everybody is going to start juggling all these different apps you know now the social media personalities and the the news websites and things are going to have a presence on a lot of these and they are just going to aggregate their feeds and repost what they are doing but your average person your average conservative is not going to check what 's going on on parlor and let me go check what 's on me wheel let me go check what 's on cab let me check what 's on gutter let me check what 's on telegram it,0.1641,"i am just going to put that out there right now not a lot of good news to report to you here today this is going to be a rough rough couple of weeks as president from said could be a rough month hopefully it 's only a rough month and not beyond them the latest death count in the united states is over 5,100 yesterday we saw in excess of a thousand deaths in the united states from coronavirus in italy in excess of 720 deaths in spain in excess of 900 deaths in france in excess of 500 deaths in the uk nearly 600 deaths so this thing is beginning to spike in terms of death across the west the question is when it peaks how long that peak lasts whether the summer kills it off the stats are ugly at this point they are going to get ugly over the next couple of weeks because as we identify new cases there 's a time delay between when the cases are identified and when people actually die from this stuff meanwhile we are hearing reports that the death toll in even countries that are being open like italy might be greatly undercounted according to the wall street journal margarita stein katya and eric silver 's reporting in the town of cocoa leo in hours drive east of here the local nursing home is out east of milan a local nursing home lost over a third of its residents in march none of the 24 people who died that were tested for coronavirus nor were the 38 people who died in another nursing home in the nearby town of lodi these are not isolated incidents italy 's official death toll from the virus stands at 13,000 155 the most of any country in the world but that number tells only part of the story because many people who died from the virus do not make it to the hospital and are never tested so just as i have been saying all along there are tons and tons of people who are not being tested who have corn virus and are not dying there are also tons of people who are dying and are not being tested because by the time they die it 's too late to test them they are not at the hospital most people dying outside the hospital so probably the estimates go that may be twice as many people are dead in italy as we already know about meanwhile over at the white house experts are apparently telling the white house that research is showing corona virus can be spread not just by sneeze or coughs which should create that six foot radius that you are supposed to be outside of but also just by talking or possibly even breathing which is just wonderful and does suggest that everyone 's an idiot for suggesting we should not be wearing face masks full - time well the current corona virus specific research is limited the results of available studies are consistent with aerosolization of virus from normal breathing according to the letter written by dr . harvey fineberg chairman of a committee with the national academy of sciences feinberg says that he will start wearing a mask when he goes to the grocery store he 's i am not going to wear a surgical mask clinicians it needs need those but have a nice western - style bandana i might wear or i have a ba ba balaclava had some pretty nice options and doctor foul she told cnn on tuesday the idea of recommending broad use of masks in the u.s . to prevent spread of corona virus is under very active discussion by the group which of course is not a great shock it 's just that for weeks they have been telling us nobody should wear a mask it 's actually counterproductive and a waste of time meanwhile foreign countries like israel have been mandating that everyone everybody wear masks when they go into public aerosolization is basically worst - case scenario for the passage of a virus there there are a few different ways that viruses can get passed if it 's like ebola then it has to be passed directly through bodily liquid if you are if you are looking at what the original perception of coronal virus was then it could be passed by coughing right larger droplets that land on somebody 's face and then get into their nose or mouth aerosolization is you breathe",0.4568,superintendent scott ziegler told the public quote to my knowledge we do not have any record of assaults occurring in our bathrooms virginia law requires that reports shall be made to the division superintendent and to the principal or his designee on all incidents involving sexual assault the daily wire asked lcps questions last week including quote has stone bridge ever reported the may alleged sexual assault in any statistics or made anyone aware of it lcps hid behind state law with director of communications joan salgren replying quote any information related to student information is confidential under state and federal laws regarding student privacy however state law actually requires statistics on assault and other incidents in schools to be reported to the public in the form of annually updated statistics available on a public database called safe schools information resource administered by the virginia department of education in other words the school board and the school does not have to report to the public the name of the people involved the juveniles involved but they do have to report the numbers lcps reported to the state that stonebridge had zero sexual assaults for the 2020 - 2021 school year which includes may 28 2021 virginia law says the super the division superintendent shall annually report all such incidents to the doe for the purpose of recording the frequency of such incidents on forms that shall be provided to the department and shall make such information available to the public the issue with missing sex assault statistics in loudoun is not limited to the latest case raising the prospect and untold numbers of sexual assaults and other infractions have gone unreported in october 2018 in a case that was widely reported by the media at the time three football players at tuscarira tuscarera high were arrested and charged with sexual assault a source told local media it 's believed a younger player was held down by teammates who inserted victims who inserted objects into the victim in a locker room the spokesperson for lcps said at the time the case will be subject to disciplinary action the annual report for tuscarera that you reported zero instances of sexual offenses against students lcps provided no response at all to the daily wires questions about the reason for the zero figures despite having two days to do so while the suspect in the may 28th alleged assault was not arrested until july 8 following the conclusion of an investigation police officers were present at the school that day law enforcement was notified and a police report was filed but was not clear who filed the report pile of the state spokesman told said that the sssr 's mandatory reporting is not contingent on the filing of charges by law enforcement or subsequent convictions in other words if this was reported to the cops that just means that it has to be reported in the stats but it was not reported in the stats additionally the safety stats for that school year were not due to the state until july 16th and in the case of tuscarera the school year did not end until months after the incident and arrests if the district still reported zero and has for every single year since on wednesday lcps put out a statement it did not send it to the daily wire it said quote loudoun county sheriff 's office was contacted within minutes of receiving the initial report on may 28th once a matter has been reported to law enforcement lcps does not begin its investigation until law enforcement advises lcps it has completed a criminal investigation furthermore we can not discipline any student without following title ix grievance processes but an email from stonebridge principal tim flynn which was sent to the entire community at 448 the day of the alleged rape told students and parents that quote there was an incident in the main office area today that required the loudoun county sheriff 's office to dispatch deputies to stonebridge this corresponds to the story offered by scott smith the victim 's father who said the police arrived because the school called them on him for making a scene about his impression it was not treating the incident seriously so this is a disaster area for loudoun county if it turns out that the loudoun county schools have not been reporting these stats on sexual assault to the public just another indicator that when you have institutions that are very powerful they have every incentive to cover up all of the bad things happening within those institutions this is true across institutions people develop institutional loyalty when they work for those institutions and they do not want to report the bad stuff happening inside the institutions and that 's how you end up with children being put in danger now for the left they do not care apparently if those children are put in danger by the public schools and they are they are a wide variety of cases in which teachers have have made prey out of their students in public schools across the country those statistics are in fact somewhat available it 's a national story when it 's the catholic church it 's not a national story when it turns out that it 's the public school system obviously even though there are many many more members of the public school system in the united states than there are members of the catholic church who are subject to predation there 's certainly an ideological component here and meanwhile the family of that girl who 's allegedly raped in her school bathroom is now pursuing civil action against the loudoun county public schools under title ix so there will in fact be a lawsuit the parents of the young girls state a quote subsequent to the sexual assault on our daughter loudoun county public schools formalized the policy regarding restroom use that was easily exploitable by a potential sexual assailant because of poor planning and misguided policies loudoun schools fail to institute even minimal safeguards to protect students from sexual assault the lawyer for the family says the conduct of loudoun county schools and loudoun school board directly resulted in the brutal rape of smith 's daughter at stonebridge high it only takes an instant to see how loudoun county schools have adversely affected this family and have harmed their daughter so all of this has resulted in some pretty bad news for terry mcauliffe who 's running for governor of virginia and who is completely in hawk to the teachers unions in the state of virginia he was asked yesterday about whether parents should be in charge of education and this of course remains a major issue right across the country parents would like to be in charge of their children 's education public schools are delegated your kids to educate them in the ways that you see fit they are not delegated to the power to educate them solely as they see fit because frankly they are not qualified to do so nor empowered to do so that is not the purpose of local public schools and the federalization of the process has made this worse it 's created a massive disconnect between the bureaucrats who are supposed to educate your children and you this is why increasingly parents are taking their kids out of the public schools putting them in private schools homeschooling them trying to find charter schools doing anything they can to remove to remove the monopoly on indoctrination now provided by liberal teachers unions and the and the state - run schooling system and so terry mcauliffe was asked about all of this because he had said in open debate with one younkin in virginia that parents essentially have no interest in the education of their kids,0.5121,g is for gun a gun is an evil deadly creature that at any moment may leap into the hand of an innocent madman and kill everyone around him many innocent madmen have suffered at the hands of guns there they were standing in a crowd or a military facility or a gay bar minding their own business and shouting allahu akbar when suddenly a gun leapt into their hands and opened fire thus ruining the innocent madman 's life many a person has become a criminal simply because he was standing on a dark street demanding a fellow citizen hand over his wallet when some opportunistic gun jumped into his hand and mayhem ensued this would not happen if guns were banned if guns were banned the criminal would say to himself i was going to rob that person at gunpoint but guns have been banned so i will simply demand that he give me his money and if he refuses well all the worse for me women have been particularly victimized by guns it 's easy to see why say some five foot two hundred pound woman is dragged into a dark alley by a muscle - bound six foot four male who wishes to engage in what to him would be a meaningful relationship if the woman has a gun she might blow this guy to hell and gone and thus miss out on an amazing interpersonal experience so as you can see guns are especially bad for women most importantly guns are very dangerous to leftists you see leftists believe that your property and your conscience should belong to the state they back up those beliefs with laws that are enforced by people with guns if you refuse to hand your property and conscience over to the state these people with guns will come to your house and arrest you if on the other hand you also have a gun an ugly situation may ensue this is not just theoretical it is based on a true story that happened in 1776 so be warned guns are unhealthy for leftists because guns protect our property and our conscience and they keep us free and we would not want that g is for gun i am andrew clavin with the lefties dictionary,0.5246
so they ask them you know if this guy comes to your company what what are you guys going to do you know because you guys are leading major dei departments what is your plan and the reporter said they were shocked they were expecting these people to all say we are we are just going to ignore him or we are going to dig in our heels or whatever every single dei person they talked to said we 'd have to re - evaluate our policies because there 's no denying that there 's a real sizable interest in movement there and you know for our company we have to look at what is the potential you know net loss of us digging in on this so we are talking about them interviewing mainstream media interviewing some of the ideological creatures who were responsible for a lot of this mess and they are even admitting at this point that like they 'd have to go to the drawing board with their executives and they are doing that out of a survival instinct you know it 's it 's something that i think is not surprising because if they want to survive in their workplace they want to you know survive to exist and maybe reform in some other version later on they have to find a way to seem somewhat sensible at the moment but that on its own is a sign that we are making sizable you know sort of change within the workplace because that 's pitting them into a new real reality where they have to go back to hiding in some sense um and you know i hate the idea that you know anything we do is to force anybody into hiding because i actually i prefer a world where everything 's kind of out in the open and people debting things like that but there are certain places institutions where i feel like really like workplaces your politics and and your views on sex or whatever it may be do not belong at work you know unless it 's a central thing to your job that 's never been an acceptable thing at work you know if i had gone to work in the early 2000s started talking about who i like to have sex with you know,0.1017,but i go back to what i said in the beginning i am curious as to what was really going on with the russia gate investigation because as we now know some of those fisa warrants were bad meaning crossfire hurricane that famous operation that you know launched into investigating the trump campaign before he was even in office before he was elected it was a bunk investigation that there well for the most part now the horowitz report said that there was a you know alleged legitimate reason to investigate whatever the reason i am bringing this up is why do not trump drain the swamp as soon as he got an office i mean honestly he could not when he fired comey that 's when everything went nuts that 's when they decide to launch a special prosecutor and they put us through years of russia gate insanity which was all fake news the whole thing was bunk and now trump is finally getting what they are calling his revenge with bill barr coming in there now angry saying it 's his stooge his lackey they want barre impeached unfortunately trump 's the president and it seems like he 's going after these holdovers these permanent employees and the media has been going after him for it check out the story from vox trump 's purged president trump 's interference with roger stone sentencing shows the real lesson he took from impeachment that he has impunity trump could fire whoever he wants these people serve at the pleasure of the president i believe it was obama who bolstered the national security council but trump could not really fire a whole lot of people when they were investigating him in the russia gate nonsense and he could not do it during ukraine gate either so finally we get an end to the russia gate insanity trump starts actually making some moves as we can see here from a cnn story from august trump 's purged of his own national security team is almost complete now i get it these people were trump 's people but trump was trying to find people loyal to him whether you like it or not and he was firing people who contradicted him and who he do not like because like obama said you need unity and loyalty in the administration to make it function properly what did they say back in august that dynamic has flipped now people are seeing the intelligence community not as something that should be constrained but something that should constrain the president that 's kind of weird donald trump is the duly elected president he 's supposed to he 's supposed to serve because he was elected to do so why would the unelected intelligence agencies be seen as something that needs to constrain the president clearly you can see the conflict between trump and the intelligence community unfortunately for trump someone in the intelligence community started the whole impeachment process and now trump can not do anything about it at least while impeachment is going on that 's why when impeachment ended trump makes his move i will point out i can not actually tell you the name of the individual who was reported to have been colluding with one of adam shifts staff members this is reported by real clear investigations certified by my news guard as a legitimate news that said multiple sources confirm a man i can not name years ago working with another man named shawn misko we are talking about how they would remove the president by any means necessary that man misko then joined adam shift staff then gave advice to this whistleblower who i can not name and that was used as a pretext to launch the ukraine gate investigation of donald trump once again putting his moves on hold trump has been constrained every step of the way a lot of people might think it 's a good thing but trump wanted to drain the swamp and get rid of these holdovers many of whom have resigned but let me show you something first they are now saying that trump installs loyalists to top jobs after impeachment purge well obviously i do not think that really matters you get the point,0.3487,but it will be about more proactive ways yeah to punish certain people and now you know we are talking about reparations now and a whole slew of other things i think that 's already happening in some ways where you have a situation where you know on campuses on universities and in other areas of life you have affirmative action and other measures you know many of which started out with good intentions which are now being used to elevate certain social groups and to demean or handicap other social groups i think we are already seen the origins of that i think it will go further and further you know one of my big problems with this culture of hatred towards certain privileged groups is that it 's so anti intellectual it 's so wrong you know so for example white men is it 's absolutely acceptable and in fact cherished to hate white men and you think so well hold on white men includes very poor people hard - working people the the man who cleans your toilet the man who fixes things in your house when they go wrong it includes fire fighters who will save your life you ungrateful idiots if anything bad happens it includes soldiers includes all these people and then it includes incredibly wealthy people and credit you know the minority people who run businesses people who are bosses and so on so what the politics of identity does i think one of the key things it does it completely erases the question of class it completely erases the question of who has things and who does not have things and that 's someone who comes from the left traditionally i find that really worrying where a whole swathe of people is just categorized as bad on the basis of the color of their skin with no discussion about the divisions within that group of people in terms of class in terms of influence in terms of work and everything else so to me it 's just as bad as when i was growing up and people would do the same in relation to black people they would say all black people are questionable by the basis that they have a certain skin color that was wrong that was wicked that was an evil approach to life because it do not take into consideration the fact that there are vastly different kinds of black people the majority of them are good hard - working decent people and if some are committing crimes it tends to be a minority it tends to be a specific problem so it was racist to suggest that all black people were a problem i similarly think it 's racist to say it 's racially charged to suggest that white men are a bad thing it does not take into consideration the fact that there are vast moral class political differences in this way the people so since this woke monster that 's what i always call it it 's a buzzer it 's sort of an amorphous monster that you can not quite shape or fully understand because it 's always changing and changing the rules and all those things but because it does not seem to really be going anywhere let us say do you think that that the populist movements that are now rising up all over europe are the only way to get out of this and are you worried about that where that could potentially lead because i think this is a little bit where every time you talk about populism you start talking about nationalism yaks thing you know people think you are talking about f no national,0.154,the police executed three search warrants in the russell neighborhood seizing several guns and narcotics among the six people subsequently arrested was jamarcus glover brianna taylor 's ex - boyfriend on january second using a surveillance camera police saw a white chevy impala pull up in front of 2424 elliott avenue which is one of the houses hit with a search warrant a few days earlier glover got out of the passenger side of the car registered to taylor glover is seen driving to taylor 's springfield drive apartment and walking inside on january 16th after a brief stay police saw glover leave with a suspected u.s postal service package and then drive to a house on west muhammad ali boulevard which was also hit with the search warrant on december 30th on february 14th after an officer towed his car from west muhammad ali boulevard glover attempted to file a complaint against the officer the phone number he gave on the complaint was registered to taylor on march 12th the warrants were set in motion as of midday detective joshua jones an officer in the play space investigations unit of the criminal interdiction division requested five no knock search warrants from circuit judge mary shaw for an ongoing narcotics investigation okay the warrants were predicated on a 39 - page document demonstrating links between glover and taylor including prison visits and prison phone calls between taylor and glover in which they discussed the the movements of packages for example at 12 25 pm shaw signed off as the judge on the affidavits for the first two warrants for houses at 20 20 24 24 and 24 25 elliott avenue and then a few minutes later signed off on 24 26 l8 avenue and then another house at 2605 west muhammad ali boulevard and then a few minutes after that the judge signed off on the search of taylor 's apartment which was 10 10 miles away in south louisville why well because in the affidavit the officer wrote that glover 's car had made frequent trips to taylor 's springfield 's drive apartment that glover walked directly into taylor 's apartment on january 16th a u.s postal inspector verified that glover did receive packages at taylor 's apartment remember glover was running a drug trade taylor 's car had been seen in front of the elite avenue on different occasions at approximately 9 p.m taylor and her boyfriend kenneth walker this is not her ex - boyfriend jamarcus glover was her was her ex - boyfriend her new boyfriend was kenneth walker who by the way was friends with with glover apparently taylor and her boyfriend kenneth walker get home from dinner at texas roadhouse and giving a friend 's kids rides across town it was taylor 's first night off after a few consecutive days with 12 - hour shifts as an er technician they climbed in bed put on a movie at approximately 10 p.m police officers were briefed on the entry plan for taylor 's apartment just before midnight about 45 minutes before serving the warrant mattingly said he drove by taylor 's apartment while another officer detective mike campbell had an eye on the house the only thing campbell saw while watching taylor 's apartment according to mattingly was the light on the tv in the bedroom police thought taylor would be home alone inside the apartment taylor had fallen asleep watching the movie freedom writers and walker said he was starting to doze off at 12 40 am officers were in place outside taylor 's apartment and began to knock on the door remember they do not have to knock on the door because it was a no - knock warrant after a few knocks mattingly said they began to identify themselves as police there were there 's at least one witness who said they identified as police there were other witnesses who apparently said that they do not hear them identify as police they had no legal obligations to identify themselves as police you may not like no knock warrants but this is a legal procedure in louisville the knocking startled taylor and walker out of bed they began yelling out so originally we were told by the way that brianna taylor was completely asleep she was not that is only relevant in so far as they did not just shoot a sleeping woman who 's lying in bed she apparently was behind him while she was awake the knocking startled taylor and walker out of bed they began yelling out asking who was there according to walker and they do not hear a response supposedly after about a minute and hearing no response from inside police used a battering ram to knock in the front door so this is where the discrepancies begin between walker 's account and the police 's account that 's a walker says he 's yelling who 's there and the police say we do not hear him,0.5013,well i mean so far we know that 1023 is accurate hunter biden is one of the stupider humans walking the earth at this point despite apparently his massive artistic talent for money laundering perhaps the barisma executive explains the confidential source that bereavement court had to pay the bidens because ukrainian prosecutor victor shulkin was investigating barisma and explained how difficult it would be to enter the us market in the midst of that investigation the confidential source further detailed the conversation suggesting to the barisma executive that he paid the bidens 50 grand each to which the barisma executive replied it 's not 50 grand it 's 5 million dollars 5 million for one biden 5 million for the other biden apparently the document makes reference to the big guy which is said to be a reference to joe biden barisma executive told the confidential source he do not quote pay the big guy directly now you will recall that language is highly reminiscent of language that was used in documents between hunter biden and chinese investors talking about the split of money to the big guy in another investment and the question always was who was the big guy is that big guy joe biden you will recall that also joe biden openly bragged about getting victor shoken fired at the time shogun was investigating barisma hunter had a highly lucrative role on the board the nvp threatened to withhold a billion dollars of critical usaid if choking it was not fired remember donald trump was impeached for attaching supposedly attaching strings to ukrainian aid based on their investigation of brisma and now it appears that joe biden according to his allegations basically did the same thing but was taking actual bribery money in uh in coordination with it so will this be real will it end up being real unclear at this point but those allegations are now out there openly in the public representative byron donalds who has actually seen the document he 's a republican from florida he says money was being moved through accounts to get to joe biden this document also stipulates that according to the confidential human source that money was being moved through several accounts multiple accounts to get to joe biden i must say it again money was moved on purpose through multiple accounts to get to joe biden well um if that 's true then um that guy 's going to get impeached representative merger taylor green has seen the same document you make similar accusations back in 2015 20 marisma was looking to buy a u.s based oil and gas company and this came from being advised by hunter biden and his partners biden had told biden said shoken was corrupt that was around the time of this meeting was when joe biden as vice president had said that the prosecutor shogun was corrupt they hired hunter on the board to make the problems go away that 's what they specifically said the owner barisma said that hunter was stupid and that his other business partner was smart he also said that he paid 5 million to one biden and he paid 5 million to another biden and it was all a bribery to get shocking fired and in the investigation into barisma now that is what the the ukrainian source apparently said fox news has another report from one of its reporters saying that the document does not actually say that biden received any money they just tried to pay the money it 's unclear whether the money was actually received or how it was actually passed joe biden was asked about this,0.5547,well i am wrong you are resting now and the truce is not reached in gaza so now it turns out that hamas is isolated now that does not mean that joe biden is not going to attempt to force israel and cudel israel into some sort of agreement with regard to hamas one of the things that netanyahu was attempting to avoid here was the us on on biden 's way out abstaining from some sort of un security council resolution condemning israel for its action inside lebanon and probably the bargain here was he gives biden the so - called win of a ceasefire in the north and then biden vetos any attempted un security council resolution with regards to lebanon or gaza now the question is going to be whether biden even remotely keeps his word i would assume that that 's the deal that 's happening behind closed doors there and as netanyahu makes very clear here this is a ceasefire it is not an end to the war now biden is treating it as an end of the war what the deal actually says is that kisah is not allowed to ship any heavy weaponry south of lani river they are not allowed to arm up any attempt to arm up across lani river will result in a triumvirate of sources now i guess it 's the us the french the lebanese armed forces and finally israel assessing whether the violation has taken place now the problem for israel here of course is that biden has an interest in assessing that no violation of the agreement has taken place but this is what netanyahu and the israeli government also know when trump comes in different math that same agreement will be applied very differently when the trump administration comes in they are not going to have any interest in kah arming up below the lani so if they start shipping all sorts of iranian - made weaponry and russian made weaponry across the lani river the us will give israel the go - ahead and israel will have the weapons to actually do what it needs to do to finally finish off isbah in that area and by the way israel already is occupying that area basically this agreement means that israel 's troops are supposed to pull back of the so - called blue line that 's the border between lebanon and israel and the lebanese armed forces which are supposedly not affiliated with there 's some sort of complications there are going to fill that gap and then if israel intelligence which is excellent in this region actually senses that there 's rearming or shipment of new military material across the lani river then israel will appeal to this sort of group of four and at that point israel will be able to go in now that means for the next two months it 's going to be very difficult for israel to do anything because again jo biden is not going to greenlight anything but that netanyahu knows that which is why again it is a 60 - day cease this is not a coincidence it is a 60 - day ceasefire and joe biden is in office for another 56 days those numbers are very close for a reason that is why netanyahu says he by the way in his speech did not call for residents of israel 's north to go back home yet why because number one he knows they are not going to because they do not feel safe yet nor should they and two there is the presumption that without the trump administration there to actually guarantee that israel can do what it needs to do in southern lebanon the agreement is not worth the paper that it 's printed on so that is the story with regard to the ceasefire senator ted cruz points out that it 's clear the biden administration is the is the source of all of the instability in the region we will get to that in a moment first our daily wire plus black friday sale is now live get 50 % off new annual memberships right now normally this is

reason this agreement is coming about is because of american pressure but not in a good way it 's not because america is pressuring for an end to the war that secures israel it 's because joe biden has been pressuring israel not to finish off terrorists since basically december of last year he 's stopped israel from pursuing everything it needed to pursue in gaza every single step of the way while leaking israel 's actual military plans to the new york times and barack ravid on a consistent basis at axio the same thing is true with regard to lebanon senator ted cruz points out i deeply disturbed by both reports that obama biden officials exerted enormous pressure on our israeli allies to accept this ceasefire and by how those officials are characterizing israel 's obligations,0.9098,why is it that when a man and a woman both get drunk and then hook up with each other it is the man that assaulted the woman if the idea is you can not consent if you are drunk then would not they both have assaulted each other kind of confusing and unfair it 's not really equal is it we have been hearing a lot of stories about title nine investigations of the past few years where a woman accuses a man of some kind of sexual assault or misconduct and the university looks for a preponderance of evidence that means they just want to know if the story may be true there 's some evidence to suggest it might have happened that 's usually enough for the universities to suspend the student or kick them out entirely because of this many men have filed lawsuits against these universities and some of them have won but what happens when the roles are reversed how does the woman handle being accused that 's exactly what today 's story is about and it gets particularly strange when you hear the alleged motivation for the accusation of sexual assault or get started make sure you pop over to patreon comm /team cast and click become a patron there are many different tiers to choose from but most notably is tier 1 at $ 10 per month you get access to behind - the - scenes photos and videos and bonus commentary when available so please consider supporting my work by becoming a patron at whatever level you feel comfortable today this story from cincinnati comm lawsuit female uc student accused of sexual misconduct is a victim of slut - shaming a female university of cincinnati students who was suspended over alleged sexual misconduct involving a male student has sued the university saying she was disciplined for engaging in the same sexual freedoms that men on the campus enjoy the lawsuit filed this week in federal court in cincinnati makes similar allegations to other cases in recent years that have named uc as well as miami university a consistent theme is that the process universities used to investigate sexual assaults is flawed and prevents accused students from being able to defend themselves all those previous local cases were filed by men according to the story the man and the woman went back to his bedroom engaged in some light sexual activity and then ultimately the man said he just wanted to go to bed while the woman asked him if there 's anything else he wanted to do according to his friends they said they tried to get her to leave but she would not because she felt that she was too drunk the male student reported his allegations to universities title 9 office saying he was too intoxicated to consent to sexual activity the lawsuit says a university hearing found the female student was responsible after a failed appeal the lawsuit says she was notified by letter in february that she would be suspended she will be eligible to re - enroll after the male student graduates or is no longer a student you see the lawsuit says was facing pressure to prosecute females accused of sexual assault because it has been named a defendant in multiple lawsuits brought by men who alleged that uc discriminates against men so there 's three potential motives one you have the man 's straightforward allegation that he was drunk and could not consent to sex therefore it was sexual assault and he filed a complaint his motivation is stated by him and that 's probably the best we can go with but there are some speculative motivations the woman is saying he in revenge against her because she had previously filed a claim against one of his friends according to reason rose lawsuit suggests that doe filed the complaint against rowe as a kind of revenge for getting his friend in trouble on information and belief john doe was motivated to file a title 9 complaint in retaliation for a prior title 9 complaint jay and rowe have filed against his friend according to the suit the woman is saying that it 's ridiculous to find her guilty when they were both drunk in which case should not they both be guilty but that 's kind of the argument many men have been bringing up over the past several years when facing these kinds of allegations reason.com presents an alternative theory of motivation so this is the third motivation this being that the man was simply scared that the woman would file a claim against him first and his only option was to be the first person to file that claim so the school would defend him it says here 's an alternative theory doe woke up realized that engaged in sexual activity while they were both drunk and feared that the woman would file a complaint against him as she had done to his friend panic - stricken he felt he had no choice but to beat her to the punch indeed if you suspect you are going to become the subject of a title 9 investigation the optimal strategy may very well be to file the first complaint for reasons not completely clear to me title 9 administrators often appear biased in favor of the initial complaintant and presume the other party is the wrongdoer now it is worth noting that in the past at the university of cincinnati a judge has defended the men in this story from 2016 it says judge sides with uc grad student accused of rape a university of cincinnati graduate student determined by uc to be responsible of violating the school 's code of conduct for sexual assault will be allowed to resume classes the spring after a federal judge 's decision rescinded a one - year suspension imposed by the university the male graduate student identified only as john doe in his lawsuit alleged the university violated due process and title 9 in how it handled the investigation and ruling of the case against him that ruling which found him responsible for sexually assaulting another female student imposed a suspension that would have started on december 10th and here 's what 's particularly interesting the students lawyer was josh engel and in the current story about the woman filing a suit against the univer she has the exact same lawyer it would make sense the lawyer is skilled in this field of law and is defending equality be it from a man or a woman universities need to be fair in their investigations but there 's a much bigger problem with this idea of being drunk and consent and there 's a few questions that i have about this how do you determine at what level of drunkenness you can not give consent is one beer enough to qualify as one shot is it it even a sip of beer what if the person had a drink before you met up and you do not know that they were buzzed tipsy or actually inebriated many people who get drunk do not present drunk in any way they look cohesive but at what level of drunkenness do you no longer have the right to consent additionally if you take some kind of drug any kind of drug that puts you under the influence including alcohol and then commits a crime or some adverse action you are held responsible for that if you get drunk and drive a car that 's your fault you can still be held responsible for your actions even though you are drunk simply because your judgment is faulty because of a substance does not mean you are not responsible for your actions and this presents a kind of dilemma as we have seen over the past few years women being told they were raped when both the man and the woman were drunk take for instance this poster we saw that went viral it says jake was drunk josie was drunk they hooked up but josie could not consent the next day jake was charged with rape a woman who is intoxicated can not give her legal consent for sex so proceeding under these circumstances is a crime it only takes a single day to ruin your life if you were to ask me it sounds like these kinds of policies actually demean women and strip away their autonomy by acting as though they are not capable human adult 's who can make reasonable decisions on their own and be held responsible for their own decisions the conundrum here is that not all substances are equal it 's one thing if someone acts actively drugs another person in an effort to manipulate them,0.3043,the fact is that the mill in balloting system has real problems with it when you have hundreds of thousands millions of ballots going out to people 's old addresses that does create the potential for people to take those ballots fill them out and send them in which is why tucker carlson on his show last night for example literally read off the voting records of dead people right this does happen if you send ballots to addresses and you do not clean cleanse the voter rolls which is something democrats have forcibly opposed right democrats have filed lawsuits to avoid cleaning the voter rolls of people who are dead well that does provide the potential for somebody to grab that particular ballot fill it in mail it back in this is particularly true when in states like california have ballot harvesting where literally people just go around picking up ballots from other people you do not even mail it in in those circumstances you have designated people from each particular party going out and picking all of those ballots up do not know what happens with them they could theoretically fill them out right this does create the potential for voter fraud and you have seen democrats in various states around the country trying to get rid of signature verification so they do not even want you to have to verify that the signature on the ballot matches the signature for when you have registered to vote in the first place right all of this creates the serious potential for voter fraud and voter irregularity all of this creates the potential for people not to trust the system and all of those things should be adjudicated not only should they be adjudicated the laws should be changed and as we have seen in certain cases the gop has been successful so for example the gop right now is suing in pennsylvania going up to the supreme court in all likelihood about this policy that was created out of whole cloth by the supreme court of pennsylvania overruling the legislature deciding that because of kovid ballots that arrived after the election could still be counted even without a postmark right the changes of those process absolutely undermine electoral integrity they absolutely undermine faith in our electoral system and all of those questions ought to be answered and we ought to fight those things out we really should these are legislative issues these are judicial issues and these all should be fought out now that 's not quite the same thing about as arguing that the proof is that all of these elections were skewed away from trump that this the outcome of this was the skewing of the election away from trump that 's something trump is going to have to show in court so for example in michigan michigan gop lawmakers have called for a full audit of the election results over serious allegations of error and voter fraud the republican senators in the michigan legislature called on jocelyn benson to do so the letter dated friday november 13th was released on thursday signed by two republican state senators tom barrett and lanathis this is according to tim pearce over at dailywire.com the senators requested that benson delay certifying election results over a spate of errors and allegations of voter fraud that have cast out on michigan 's election process the senators wrote every citizen deserves to have faith in the integrity of the election process and its outcome it is our responsibility as elected public servants to assure the people of michigan of the process 's integrity through complete transparency and the faithful investigation of any allegations of wrongdoing fraud or abuse unfortunately a number of serious allegations have been made which can not and should not be ignored now it 's true that none of that should be ignored that does not mean that the state is going to suddenly flip its electors or that they are going to hold a brand new election some of the errors that have been made in terms of voter fraud or voter irregularity are in fact just that human error some of them probably are voter fraud or voter irregularity but leon wolfe over at the blaze actually went through the affidavits that have been presented by the trump campaign 234 pages of affidavits regarding alleged voter irregularities in michigan and leon wolf again of the blaze which is a right - wing site he went through all of it and what he found is that the testimony contained in the affidavits pertains to fewer than a thousand total ballots although it should be noted that numerous afghans complained they were not able to see what was happening because they were required to maintain six feet of social distance or because people were in their way the material in the affidavit that 's alleging an atmosphere of intimidation and hostility toward gop poll workers is voluminous reading between the lines some of the frustration experienced by poll workers and refusal tens retain further complaints may have been come by honestly but there is no way to actually tell here 's the bottom line if you lose the state by 150 thousand votes it 's going to be very very difficult to challenge the results of that particular election that does not mean that we should not have a legal process,0.2941,okay so today we are going to talk about p and p is a constructivist and a constructivist is someone who 's attempting to answer the question where does your personality come from now for pj it would be more something like where do your models of the world come from but his idea of model of the world is so broad that it 's perfectly reasonable to use personality as a proxy so here 's one of p 's initial propositions the common postulate of various traditional epistemologies epistemologies are theories of valid knowledge is that knowledge is a fact and not a process and that if our various forms of knowledge are always incomplete and our various sciences still imperfect that which is acquired is acquired and can therefore be studied statically hence the absolute position of the problems what is knowledge or how are the various types of knowledge possible under the converging influence of a series of factors we are tending more and more today to regard knowledge as a process more than a state any being or object that sciences attempt to holds fast dissolves once again in the current of development it is the last analysis of this development and of it alone that we have the right to state it is a fact what we can and should then seek is the law of this process he par he puts in parenthesis we are well aware on the other hand of the fine book by thomas on scientific revolutions the first aim of genetic epistemology because that 's what he called his field is therefore if one can say so to take psychology seriously and to furnish verifications to any question which each epistemology necessarily raises yet replacing the generally unsatisfying speculative or implicit psychology with controllable analysis to know means to act human knowledge is essentially active to know is to transform reality in order to understand how a certain state is brought about knowing an object does not mean copying it it means acting upon it knowing reality means constructing systems of transformation that correspond more or less adequately to reality knowledge is a system of transformations that becomes progressively adequate in fact if all knowledge is always in a state of development and consists in proceeding from one state to a more complete an efficient one evidently it is a question of knowing this development and analyzing it with the greatest possible accuracy so here are the sorts of questions that p addressed himself to they are very fundamental questions um upon what does an individual basis judgments what are his norms how is it that these norms are validated what 's the interest of such norms for the philosophy of science in general and how does the fact that children think differently affect our presumption of fact itself more problems how do children conceptualize number in space and time and speed how do they understand that objects hidden from view are actually still there how do they understand that entities that can transform from one place to another are the same entities how do we understand chants or moral concerns play patterns and dreams or and how do we how is it that we imitate others and what does it mean that we can now here 's a definition of constructivism this is from p as well knowledge does not begin in the eye and it does not begin in the object it begins in the interactions there 's a reciprocal and simultaneous construction of the subject on the one hand and the object on the other there 's no structure apart from construction either abstract or genetic now so let us take some of that apart the first thing that p is pointing out is that trying to understand what knowledge is by referring to a body of facts seems to be somewhat problematic because sh facts shift with time and people understand facts differently at different stages of development even though hypothetically we all live in the same world it it turns out that we can get by in some sense with structures of knowledge that differ from one another i think the easiest way to understand that is actually to take something like a pragmatic perspective and pragmatist,0.1971,oh jesus only jesus jesus only preach god 's message directly and coveted twelve people that were to go out and spread the word to everybody else so when i am what i am saying is people need to stop being hyper religious and be willing to explain themselves more so then turn to god turn away from trump turn away from that when you turn to god you should have enough understanding to say the trump should be the president when you turn the guy that you understand god is showing you that trump should be the president because hillary clinton is going to ruin the whole world and one christianity in america when you turn to god the men of god the women of god will then help articulate messages that god want you to hear from people it 's all i am saying who wrote the bible god do not write the god do not sit down and come up come above his throne write the bible he used people to write the messages that we now called the bible he used prophets to speak the prophecy which we called the book of prophets that 's all i am saying so i am saying god uses people too so do not do not do not blindly say do not trust god because it sound good and sound religious and cute because to be honest when you say trust god you need that you need to actually trust god and know what god you trust him because some of you all not talking to you all perfect some of you all other people believe in fate guys and in pagan gods and the god of your pastor you a living the god of the bible you ai not even heard of him you believe in a god of your the god of your church not not so much as god of the word there 's been preached for thousands of years let i got to get out for you,0.391,so if this thing goes the way the democrats are suggesting if they actually get hunter biden up to testify it is not going to be joe biden called to testify in a truth - to - power moment it 's going to be hunter - biden testifying and then if they do call joe biden do you think that joe biden is quick on his feet now media will cover him as a hero the media will suggest that he is put upon the media will suggest that all of this is nonsense but here 's the reality it 's going to look good for joe biden that he has to testify about why his son was picking up bags of cash and he was looking the other way why he was flying his son to china that his son could do deals in china using the vice presidential jet i mean all of that is going to come up and that ai not going to be great for the democrats which brings us to the democratic side of the 2020 race so hillary clinton started to walk back yesterday her comments in the hollywood reporter that she might not support bernie sanders where he the nominee you will recall that she did an interview with the hollywood reporter in which she blasted bernie sanders she said that nobody liked him unloading on the culture around him quote his online bernie bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors particularly the women accusing him of permitting this anti - woman culture and then i like bernie trended on twitter for much of the day some of the other democratic candidates 2020 weighed in both tulsi gabbard and tom steyer tweeted out that they like bernie at least when it comes to tom steyer the feeling is not mutual there are 1 000 tapes of tom steyer trying to be best friends with bernie and bernie brushing him off like michael scott to toby in the office sanders said on a good day my wife likes me here is bernie 's response to hillary clinton 's comments yesterday secretary clinton as you know said that uh as a senator you have got nothing done and that no one likes you what 's your response to that on a good day my wife likes me so let us let us clear the outlet and then hillary clinton came back and she basically said i do not know what you are all bitching about she said really this is what she actually tweeted i thought everyone wanted my authentic unvarnished views fair points to hillary but to be serious the number one priority for our country and world is retiring trump and as i always have i will do whatever i can to support our nominee so she walks that one back she walks that one back meanwhile the the rest of the democratic field continues to be just a mess tulsi gabbard has now hit hillary clinton with a 50 million defamation lawsuit which is pretty wonderful she 's accusing former secretary of state clinton of deliberately spreading false accusations that gabbard is a russian asset in a lawsuit seeking upwards of 50 million dollars in damages according to foxnews.com and during october 2019 interview with the podcast campaign headquarters with david plouffe clinton suggested the 2020 presidential candidate was the favorite of the russians in a russian asset gabbard says these statements are not true clinton had clinton should have known that at the time her brief says rather than facts or reliable evidence clinton 's basis for the definite defamatory statements was one or both of her own imagination or b extremely dubious conspiracy theories that any reasonable person and especially clinton a former u.s senator and secretary of state would know to be fanciful wholly unverified and inherently and objectively unreliable gabbard 's complaint states in no uncertain terms tulsi is not a russian asset and that neither russia nor anyone else controls her or her presidential campaign as for why clinton would make such statements gabbard claims clinton has quote a unique personal connection to tulsi that animates her hostility toward tulsi and her presidential campaign so it will be fun to watch that one play out in court meanwhile the democrats continue to make bizarre cases for why they ought to be the leader of the free world joe biden yesterday suggested that china is not a threat to the united states and that we should actually be helping china which is a weird take when china is attempting to expand its 5 g systems into impoverished areas of the world simply so that they can get those nations to be indebted to them and then they can effectuate their foreign policy china has been stealing our intellectual property getting more aggressive they have been building up their military resources at an extraordinary clip according to joe biden though we need to be friends with them which is because he 's been wrong on everything why would not he be wrong on this we talk about china as our competitor we should be helping and benefiting ourselves by doing that but the idea that china 's going to eat our lunch was like i remember the base in the late 90s remember japan was bonus give me a break china is not going to eat our lunch economically but that 's not really the question the question is whether they are going to get aggressive in spheres around the world which they have and which they did consistently during the obama administration meanwhile elizabeth warren desperately trying to get some attention so elizabeth warren has been dropping in the polls she 's unlikely to win either iowa or new hampshire the current real clear politics polling average has joe biden up now in iowa which is horrible news for the rest of the field if joe biden wins iowa basically this race is over the last two polls have joe biden up six on the rest of the field in new hampshire warren is now polling in the real politics poll average fourth behind sanders biden and booty judge so she is in serious serious trouble here and so now she 's releasing ads trying to claim that president trump fears her the most and thus you should hand her the nomination even though it is very obvious and i promise you in the trump orbit elizabeth warren is one of the ones that they would rather have they would rather have warren than have biden because warren has pretty much,0.5551,robert muller finally comes forward and makes an enormous statement and the supreme court speaks out about abortion we will explain i am ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show well you know that feeling when you have planned out an entire show and then five minutes before the show the entire

morning greta garbo speaks robert muller who 's been absolutely silent for nigh on two years at this point came to the podium to announce that he was done mic drop he 's out now we sort of have to back up for a second and explain what robert muller 's role was supposed to be here who is the special prosecutor in what was a counterintelligence investigation originally the counterintelligence investigation was about russian collusion russian participation in the 2016 election on the basis of that brought a bevy of prosecutions against people who are part of the trump campaign and not part of the trump campaign against people like paul manafort people like george papadopolis and also against a bunch of russians who are actually involved in election in election interference and so that was bob miller 's mandate and then that mandate expanded to include investigation of obstruction of justice now bob muller sort of claimed in the muller report that he do not actually have the authority to recommend a prosecution of the president of the united states because of a 1973 office of legal counsel department of justice memo that said a sitting president can not be indicted that memo is somewhat controversial there are some people who think the president should be able to be indicted some people think he should not but muller made clear in his report that the olc ruling he was going to abide by now just because he was abiding by the olc ruling does not mean that he would have prosecuted trump if he had the opportunity to do so in other words the olc the department of justice lete office of legal counsel memo was a threshold issue so we called a threshold issue in law the threshold issue is if that applies can you prosecute the president that does not answer the question of if it did not apply would you prosecute the president so what muller 's report basically said is we can not prosecute the president and we are not even going to reach the other issue which is should the president be prosecuted if there were no office of legal counsel memo now william bar the attorney general of the united states had suggested that muller said that he did not see sufficient evidence in the absence of the olc memo to recommend prosecution right that was what barr actually testified before congress now unless barr perjured himself both of those things can be true that muller saw the olc memo as prohibiting him from prosecuting and also even without the oil c memo he would not necessarily have the evidence to prosecute trump under obstruction of justice statutes the muller report itself is very damning of trump 's behavior and so basically what muller did,0.263,this is somebody who 's actively working with an eco - terrorist group the problem for joe biden is that his entire administration is predicated it sits atop the iceberg that is the democratic party and that iceberg has been gradually drifting to the left david shore who 's a a statistician and economist he 's of the left he points out that basically all change in terms of policy in terms of both parties has come from the left since 2010 the the right the republican party has been basically stagnant in terms of its policy prescriptions and positions since 2010 the democratic party has been moving ever more steadily to the left and people of the left have begun to acknowledge this they begin to acknowledge yes we are getting more radical now what they say is our radicalism is justified and good but there is no question that joe biden himself has moved to the left and this administration which promised to be a return to some semblance of normalcy might be more normal in terms of joe biden not tweeting but it is certainly less normal in terms of policy this was always the great disconnect with trump is that trump said crazy things all the time but trump 's actual policy was mainstream republican policy very often embracing centrist policy in terms of spending proposals his foreign policy was basically normal hawkish republican foreign policy although with more of a sort of isolationist bent than traditional american republican foreign policy his tax policy was very traditional republican policy his domestic regulatory policy was traditional republican policy joe biden however has stacked his administration with people who are radicals his democratic party has decided to overthrow years decades actually of bipartisan agreement on key issues so for example nancy pelosi has announced that the democratic party is going to ram through a revision of the hyde amendment the height amendment has been an agreement between democrats and republicans that regardless of where you stand on abortion federal tax dollars should not be used for individual abortions federal tax dollars if you are going to spend them at planned parenthood they are supposed to be used to cover planned parenthood 's front office now we all understand that there 's a little bit of a legal lie going on here that money is fungible if you send planned parenthood money to cover its front office staff then all the money they were going to use for their front office staff they are now going to use for abortions but at least the idea was that there was an agreement between republicans and democrats that abortion should not be federally funded democrats however have decided that abortion is an overt good it is not that abortion ought to be safe legal and rare as in the clinton days which at least allowed for the possibility of some crossover between left and right on abortion policy because after all if the left acknowledges that abortion is a moral tragedy then even if they want it to remain legal they are not at least quote unquote pro - abortion but the democratic party has now embraced an abortion these sort of shout your abortion idea be proud of your abortion abortion is not merely a horrible thing that sometimes is necessary as democrats used to argue now abortion is a point of pride you can not actually usher yourself into the full flower of womanhood another word that has no meaning according to the democrats unless you have an abortion lena dunham said this uh fairly openly a few years ago when she said she wishes she had had an abortion so that she could have really enjoyed the full freedoms of the law well nancy pelosi and joe biden both of whom used to basically go along with the consensus view that federal taxpayer dollars should not be used for abortion now they have reversed themselves joe biden did it a couple of years ago he had said that he was in favor of the height amendment then he reversed himself because he needed to move to the left now nancy pelosi is saying the same thing now one of the great i think annoyances for many catholics in the country watching joe biden and nancy pelosi say this stuff is that very often they say this stuff in the name of catholicism and i am going to go with the pope and jesus not super huge on abortion i do not have to be a christianity expert to point out that abortion has been sort of a major issue for the catholic church since literally the entire catholic church but here 's nancy pelosi making the case that abortion is actually a positive good taxpayers should fund abortion she starts off by talking about her catholic faith and then she 's like ah my catholic thing,0.6455,so if you station nato troops there then you basically say to putin listen if you cross this particular line you are going to start killing nato troops and at that point we have to get directly involved the problem with setting a red line with regard to chemical or biological weapons is that if putin uses them are you willing to go to full - scale boots on the ground war with vladimir putin over his use of chemical or even tactical battlefield nuclear weapons okay if vladimir putin decides he 's just going to level population centers what exactly are you going to do about it this is the this is the real question for the west right now because as that box tightens in around vladimir putin and as zolensky feels that he might be able to win this thing out right because too many russian troops are getting killed what happens if putin just decides to go for it this is what brett stevens over the new york times is writing about today he says before the invasion we had the russian invasions of georgia crimea in eastern ukraine the russian carpet bombing of aleppo the use of exotic radioactive and chemical agents against russian dissidents on british soil russian interference in u.s elections the murder of boris and msoff the blatant poisoning and imprisonment of alexian valny where any of these sovereignty violations legal violations treaty violations war crimes and crimes against humanity met with a strong united punitive response that could have averted the next round of outrageous said western responses to other violations of global norms syria 's use of chemical weapons against civilians beijing 's eradication of hong kong 's autonomy iran 's war by proxy against its savers give vladimir putin pause in short did putin have any reason to think before february 24th he would not be able to get away with this invasion he did not the west has spent 22 years placating putin through a long cycle of resets and wrist laps the devastation of ukraine is the fruit of this appeasement the biden administration now faces the question of whether it wants to bring the cycle to an end and the answer is not clear sanctions have hurt the russian economy arms shipments to ukraine have helped slow the russian advance russia 's brutality has unified nato this is to biden 's credit but the administration continues to operate under a series of potentially catastrophic illusions sanctions may devastate russia in the short term but the immediate struggle in ukraine it is short - term it is not long - term so if the sanctions hurt russia long term short - term does not matter all that much for for russia what do they care their economy is bad for three years but if they get what they want in ukraine that 's happening over the next six weeks army ukraine with javelin and singer missiles has wounded and embarrassed the russian military providing kiev with mig-29 fighter jets and other potentially game - changing weapon systems could help turn the tide refusing to do so may only prolong ukraine 's agony frequent suggestions putin has already lost the war or that he can not possibly win when ukrainians are united in their hatred for him or that he 's looking for an off - ramp may turn out to be right but they are grossly prematures as brett stevens this war is only in its third week it took the nazis longer to conquer poland the ability to subdue a rest of population is chiefly a function of the pain an occupier is willing to inflict and putin has no limits on that one there is now a serious risk these illusions could collapse very suddenly there 's little evidence so far putin is eager to cut his losses on the contrary to do so now jeopardize his grip on power so expect him to double down if he uses a chemical weapon or applies about or deploys a battlefield nuclear weapon in keeping with long - standing russian military doctrine does he lose more than he gains the answer the question answers itself he wins swiftly he terrifies the west he consolidates power he suffers consequences only marginally graver than the ones already inflicted and his fellow travelers in beijing tehran and pyongyang take note,0.5515,maybe she will win well joe biden might not have been all that off the mark it turns out kla harris is a very very bad candidate and so joe biden has a very strong interest in watching kla harris lose think of it this way if k harris wins then joe biden is just the transitional figure who moved out of the way to allow her to become president his entire presidency is he was too scile to run for a second term he do not voluntarily move aside they threw him off the back of the boat that is not a legacy that joe biden wants however if kla harris loses then joe biden 's legacy is he was unfairly persecuted by his own party for being too old despite his transformative accomplishments and then they substituted in a vice president they had basically foed upon him last minute in 2020 he gets to be the hero of that story he was thrown out he was victimized and now if they 'd only listened to him he might still be president that is the case that joe biden wants to make and we all know it apparently according to axios that is not speculation that is quite real the relationship between kla harris 's team and joe biden 's white house has been increasingly fraught in the final weeks before election day 10 people familiar with the situation tell axios biden 's team wants harris to win the election but many senior biden aids remain wounded by the president being pushed out of his reelect bid and are still adjusting to being in a supporting role on the campaign trail they are too much in their feelings one close harris ally said of the president 's team a sentiment shared even by some white house aids well that is definitely a way to win over your opponents is by saying that they are too much in their feelings well done team harris by the way again team biden does not wanted to win they do not team biden wants her to lose some on the harris team say the top white house aids are not sufficiently coordinating biden 's messaging and schedule to align with what 's best for the vice president 's campaign well here inlines the problem in order for kamla harris to win kamla harris needs to separate off from joe biden not just by throwing him off the back of the boat but also by carving up his policy she has to say listen i was vp,0.4211,wallet it 's getting more and more support from wallets and merchants processors and exchanges i think it 's a matter of time and people are faced between a fast cheap and reliable version of bitcoin and a super slow and expensive and unreliable version of bitcoin right there that 's the argument from the slow people the people that do not agree with you on this what 's the actual argument if we are really just talking about slow speeds and sure clunkier process obviously that does not sound good so to have fast cheap reliable transactions on bitcoin it requires a more expensive computer to run a full node but the vast vast vast majority of bitcoin users are not running a full node anyhow you have probably never run a full node in your entire life and nobody you know none of these coinbase users are running a full node coinbase runs a number of full nodes to support european transactions so if you have the bitcoin cache version will require bigger blocks which require a more powerful cpu and more storage space so right now today you can run a bitcoin full node for the bitcoin segment version literally on a twenty five dollar raspberry pi these people are ready what is that no a raspberry pi is a twenty five dollar computer,0.6001,h3h3 many youtubers talked about this i feel like since then there has not been a lot of action taken though many more people are now starting to talk about the story but let us look at some more disturbing videos there is a huge trend of drinking urine from the toilet you can see this frozen elsa spiderman drink from the toilet mega gummy bear drinking from drinking magic toilet iv mouse nailed to the toilet with blood coming out of her ass and here 's an actual child next to a toilet being hand in a toilet learn colors finger family nursery nursery rhymes drinking toilet water for the first time and sure enough you can see in the thumbnail there 's a child being handed a toy toilet to drink out of but it actually gets much creepier when you search for drink urine finger you can see cartoon characters peeing into into urinals and then female characters using a faucet to pour that urine into a glass to drink in one instance we can see 4.5 million views as to actual children are depicted peeing and drinking from a urinal mickey mouse and minnie mouse depicted in this thumbnail drinking urine many of these videos are very long some over an hour where it just repeats the same nursery rhyme over and over again in it and and this is because they are attempting to manipulate the youtube algorithm youtube prioritizes longer videos and because these tablets these ipads whatever are being handed to babies and young children they often do not skip to the next video or even touch the screen they will just sit there staring as the video plays through telling youtube this is a hive watch time and therefore the video is good the amount of disgusting and abusive videos that are on youtube is staggering and the amount of views these videos have is also downright terrifying if i were to do a full in - depth investigation into this it would take me a long time this is just the tip of the iceberg currently i am looking at another story that i can not talk about right now but is substantially worse there is a disgusting phenomenon on youtube that that hopefully i can put them together soon but for the time being i just want to give you a light overview of this absolutely strange creepy and disgusting phenomenon now this is where things are truly truly terrifying this is the automated algorithmic future that we are looking at today most of us grew up in a world where we were introduced to certain ideas through friends and family where our interactions in our daily lives determined what we thought was important and what we would or would not click on this means that the youtube algorithm kind of made sense if someone posted a video about donald trump you 'd say you know what personally do not care for him i am not going to click it in which case you told the youtube algorithm i do not much care for this video and this means that our cultural development dictated what the algorithm would show us but for these babies for these young children that are being handed these tablets by their parents and are just watching this twisted and tormented content they do not have the ability to sift through what is good and what is bad in which case the algorithm is deciding for the children what they should be watching these kids are in one of the most important developmental stages of their lives and they are watching hitler use a toilet they are watching cartoon characters drink urine and get injections this is some of the most terrifying and disgusting things i can not express this enough i feel like i am looking at dominoes falling over i am looking at the snowball rolling down the hill the algorithm is dictating procedurally what these kids should watch these titles to these videos make absolutely no sense sometimes they are not even actual sentences it 's just a string of random words and these kids are watching this i am worried that this will cause developmental problems in these children or just cause psychological problems later in life when i grew up the content that that i was given was was chosen by an adult to be educational but now because of the youtube 's algorithm because of social media algorithms people can just put educational in the tag and then show a picture of minnie mouse with her ass bleeding or they can show a minion drinking urine and that 's what the with the algorithm has determined these children should watch so now let us look at a video of donald trump versus hitler nursery rhyme when i first saw this i thought it was absolutely ridiculous how is this a nursery rhyme for children,0.1634,i got nothing for you really nothing now by the way this is all very silly because the reality is according to dr marty mccary who 's been a frequent guest on this program from johns hopkins university he 's a professor over there at the school of medicine he has an article in the wall street journal pointing out that covet cases have dropped 77 percent in six weeks according dr mccary we are going to have heard immunity by april by april he says amid the dire coveted warnings one crucial fact has been largely ignored cases are down 77 over the past six weeks if a medication slash cases by 77 we 'd call it a miracle pill why is the number of cases plummeting much faster than experts predicted in large part because natural immunity from prior infection is far more common than can be measured by testing testing has been capturing only from 10 to 25 percent of infections depending on when the pandemic someone got the virus applying a time - weighted case capture average of one in 6.5 to the cumulative 28 million confirmed cases would mean about 55 percent of americans already have natural immunity now add people getting vaccinated as of this week 15 percent of americans have received the vaccine the figure is rising fast former food and drug commissioner scott gottlieb estimates 250 million doses will have been delivered to some 150 million people by the end of march says dr makari there is reason to think the country is racing toward an extremely low level of infection as more people have been infected most of whom have mild or no symptoms there are fewer americans left to be infected at the current trajectory i expect covert will be mostly gone by april allowing americans to resume normal life he says the antibodies studies almost certainly underestimate natural immunity antibody testing does not capture antigen - specific t cells which develop memory once they are activated by the virus survivors of the 1918 spanish flu were found in 2008 90 years later to have memory cells still able to produce neutralizing antibodies researchers at sweden 's karolinska institute found the percentage of people mounting a t - cell response after mild or asymptomatic coping 19 infection consistently exceeded the percentage with detectable antibodies coveted 19 deaths in the united states would also suggest much broader immunity than recognized about 1 in 600 americans has died of cova-19 which translates to a population fatality rate of about 0.15 percent the covet 19 infection fatality rate is about 0.23 percent these numbers indicate that roughly two - thirds of the us population has had the infection in my own conversations with medical experts says dr makari i have noticed they too often dismiss natural immunity arguing we do not have the data the data certainly does not fit the classic randomized control trial model of the old guard medical establishment there 's no control group but the observational data is compelling he says that his prediction that coveted will basically be gone by april is based on lab data mathematical data published literature and conversation with experts it 's also based on direct observation of how hard testing has been to get especially for the poor if you live in a wealthy community we are worried people are vigilant about getting tested you might think most infections are captured by testing if you have seen the many barriers for testing to low - income americans you might think very few infections have been captured keep in mind most infections are asymptomatic which still triggers natural immunity as makari points out her immunity has been well documented in the brazilian city of manaus where researchers in the lancet reported the prevalence of covenanting infection to be 76 resulting in a significant slowing of the infection so basically what he 's saying is there 's a lot of public pressure not to talk about hurt immunity because people freak out but the reality is we are almost there we are almost there but notice democrats are not enthusiastic about talking about us being almost there nancy pelosi is out there saying maybe even after mass vaccination we still will not reopen okay at this point you got to say these people love the they love the control they love the control at the beginning of this pandemic i thought it was completely fair to talk about lockdowns i talked about it on the show right slowing the spread maintenance i explained it on the program one of the things i said is the problem with slowing the spread now is that there will be widespread spread later which of course was true but once it became clear the trajectory of the virus and how it acted it has become clearer and clearer and the way the democrats acted about this i was living in l.a where we were locked down i mean locked down tight welded in our homes i mean you could not go out to a park they shut down parks they took yellow tape and put it around parks they shut down beaches they shut down hiking trails in l.a and then the minute the george floyd protest started then it was like,0.4533,harassment allegations vice media announced tuesday that a pair of top executives have been sidelined amid a sexual harassment scandal that has unsettled the brooklyn based upstart in a memo to staff obtained by cnn money sara broderick of isis chief financial officer and chief operating officer said that company president andrew crichton and chief digital officer mike germano have each been put on leave more than a week after the new york times published a highly anticipated article that included allegations against each of them echoing what co - founders shane smith and suroosh alvi said in response to the times story broderick noted that vice intends to achieve pay parity by the end of the year she also said that vice is committed to 50/50 male - female at every level across the organization by 2020 and that mandatory sexual harassment training will be announced later this week this video is not about vice this video is about gender identity and parity in new york city and in the unites states in general the reason i bring this up is that vice announced as part of the scandal as part of the damage control they are doing that they are going to have 50/50 male / female paree across the board at every level of their company now i tweeted something out about this new york recognizes 31 genders not two so vice is making this the claim that they are going to achieve male / female parity but i started to wonder is that essentially discrimination to announce that of the 31 genders recognized by new york city you are going to highlight two of them and achieve them 5050 that would in my opinion serve to say you will literally exclude all other genders because if 50 percent are men and 50 percent are women and the rest the genders are being excluded now this argument starts to become kind of like pulling hairs but it 's an argument that needs to be brought because there are certainly people on one side saying yes this is an issue of ice by only highlighting two genders are omitting 29 as recognized by new york city and the other side saying this is about biological sex and not about gender and the whole gender argument becomes particularly confusing now i am not making this video to condemn or condone any of new york city 's laws simply to bring up an argument that needs to be made so let us move forward according to new york city human rights commission in new york city it 's illegal to discriminate on the basis of gender identity and gender expression in the workplace in public places and in housing the new york city commission on human rights is committed to ensuring that transgender and gender non - conforming new yorkers are treated with dignity and respect and with that threat of discrimination or harassment now want to stop right there and this exemplifies the point that i needed to bring up it is illegal to discriminate against people based on their gender and in this document we can see thirty - one genders are listed by gendered crossdresser drag king drag queen femme queen female to male ftm gender bender genderqueer male to female mtf non - op hydra pan gender transsexual / transsexual trans person woman man butch two - spirit trans a gender third sex gender fluid non - binary transgender androgen gender gifted gender blender femme person of transgender experience androgynous now i understand at the exact statement they said was male / female which may be a reference to biological sex and not social construct gender and as we can see in many of these names the depictions listed in the human rights commission they are not talking about biological sex per se when they lists gender they are talking about sort of subcategories around a person 's biological sex however the argument is still made that male / female essentially is a reference to gender in which case if vice is publicly and privately stating they are going to achieve 5050 male / female they are excluding the 29 other genders protected by new york city but new york city protects more than just these 31 genders it 's not limited to them they explicitly state that gender could be something else entirely gender identity one 's internal deeply - held sense of one 's gender as may female or something else entirely a transgender person is someone whose gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth gender expression external representations of gender as expressed through for example one 's name pronouns clothing haircut behavior voice or body characteristics society identifies these as masculine and feminine although what is considered masculine and feminine changes over time and varies by culture many transgender people align their gender expression with their gender identity rather than the sex they were assigned at birth according to the document individuals have the right to work and live free from discrimination and harassment due to their gender identity expression use the bathroom or locker room most consistent with their gender identity and/or expression without being required to show proof of gender be addressed with their preferred pronouns and name without being required to show proof of gender follow dress codes and grooming standards consistent with their gender identity expression now to better understand the legal obligations of businesses in new york city we should look at the actual legal definition of gender according to the new york human rights commission the term gender shall include actual or perceived sex and shall also include a person 's gender identity self - image appearance behavior or expression whether or not that gender identity self - image appearance behavior or expression is different from that traditionally associated with the legal sex assigned to the person at birth important notes for this are behavior expression and self - image because that is extremely broad i did actually speak with a lawyer about this about what it may or may not mean and there are some things to consider but we will get to that in a second let us look at some of the requirements that businesses have in new york city according to nyc gov new york city commission on human rights legal enforcement guidance on discrimination on the basis of gender identity or expression local law number 3 2 0 0 to nyc admin code 8 102 23 this document covers failing to use an individual 's preferred name or pronoun refusing to allow individuals to utilize single sex facilities and programs consistent with their gender stereotyping imposing different uniforms or grooming standards based on sex or gender and the rest is general discrimination but let us look at some of these new york city human rights law requires employers and covered entities to use an individual 's preferred name pronoun and title regardless of the individuals sex assigned at birth anatomy gender medical history appearance or the sex indicated on the individuals identification most individuals and many transgender people use female or male pronouns and titles some transgender and gender non - conforming people prefer to use pronouns other than he / him / his or she / her / hers such as they then theirs or z here many transgender and gender non - conforming people choose to use a different name than the one they were given at birth all people including employees tenants customers and participants in programs have the right to use their preferred name regardless of whether they have identification in that name or have obtained a court - ordered name change except in very limited circumstances where certain federal state or local laws require other eyes for example purposes of employment eligibility verification with the federal government asking someone their preferred gender pronoun and preferred name is not a violation of the ny ch r ella it gives examples of violations intentional or repeated refusal to use an individual 's preferred name pronoun or title for example repeatedly calling a transgender woman him or mr .,0.511,so pat toomey is the is the senator from pennsylvania now in order for you to understand how absurd it is what president trump says right here you have to understand that pat toomey is one of the left most members of the us senate on guns so in 2013 it was it was pat toomey who proposed a piece of legislation in the aftermath of sandy hook with senator joe manchin from west virginia democrat and that piece of legislation would have forced federal background checks for any sale of any weapon in the united states except between family members or close friends so if i wanted to sell a gun to somebody in the office with whom i was not friendly then i would have to go to a federally licensed firearms dealer now the only way to enforce that the problem this policy is the only way to enforce that law is that you actually have to have a full gun registry because in order for the government 's keep track of how i sold my gun to somebody they have to know that i own the gun in the first place right a federally licensed firearms dealer keeps records with the federal government they know how many guns are in that gun shop and so when that love firearms dealer is requested for records by the nra rather thee by the atf then the atf knows that where the guns were how they were transported all the rest of it that would have set up a gun registry in the united states gun registries are really troubling concept you really do not want the government knowing who has a gun and where because it 's none of the government 's business there are two purposes to the second amendment one is self - defense in which case you do not really care about the government knowing you have a gun and the second is being free of government tyranny and in that case you really do not want the government to know who has how many guns and where and obviously there 's a certain amount of of knowledge the government has with regard to federally licensed firearms dealers but having a full gun registry is not quite the same thing as all that the government would have to come into your house and check every so often the government would have to figure out whether you were telling the truth the government could theoretically charge you with perjury for lying on federal forms if you if you did not fill out the forms properly and these hand hand transfers in any case the manchin - toomey bill went down to defeat it got 54 votes in the senate it could not hit 60 but to me who had proposed it was bucking the nra when he proposed that so to me actually his nra rating was demoted from an a to a c and it was demoted from an agency not only was it demoted from an a to a c in 2014 the nra declined to endorse to me so they 'd endorsed to me in his last senatorial race and then they unendorsed to me in 2008,0.5218
